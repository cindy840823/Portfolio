# Lazada Thailand Health Product Analysis

Hi! This is a data project where I explored health and wellness products sold on Lazada Thailand. I wanted to see what types of products sell best, what pricing looks like across categories, and which cities in Thailand are most active in buying these items online.

It was a fun way to practice data cleaning, visualizations, and finding real insights that a business might care about.

## What I wanted to learn

I had a few questions I was curious about:
- Are some types of health products more expensive than others?
- Which categories or items sell the most?
- Where are most sellers located, and which cities drive the most sales?
- Do expensive products get more reviews?
- What can we learn about shoppers in different cities?

## Where the data came from

I used a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wuttipats/lazada-thailand-health-products-dataset) that includes product listings from Lazada Thailand. It has product names, prices, categories, reviews, how many units were sold, and shop locations (Thai cities). The product names are mostly in Thai, but some English is included too.

## What tools I used

This whole project was done in Google Colab using Python.  
I used:
- pandas for cleaning and handling data  
- seaborn and matplotlib for charts  
- GitHub to keep everything organized

## What I found

### 1. Some categories are priced much higher than others  
Skin care products and acne treatments had the highest average prices. Herbal and traditional remedies were usually the cheapest. It shows that some health products are considered more “premium” and others are more accessible.

### 2. Multivitamins and skincare items sold the most overall  
These categories were at the top when I looked at total units sold. This suggests a strong market demand for daily wellness and beauty items in Thailand.

### 3. Bangkok was the busiest city for sales  
Most product sales came from Bangkok. Other top cities were Pathum Thani and Nonthaburi. These are large urban areas where online shopping is likely more common.

### 4. Many of the top-selling products were affordable herbal remedies  
I created a table of the top 10 best-selling items. A lot of them cost less than 50 baht and sold in high volume. These seem to be everyday, trusted products that people buy often.

### 5. Expensive products sometimes get more reviews, but not always  
I made a scatter plot comparing price and number of reviews. There’s a small trend upward, but it’s not a strong pattern. Some cheap products also got a lot of attention.

### 6. Different cities prefer different types of products  
I made a heatmap that shows which categories sold the most in each city. Bangkok had the highest sales in every category, but other cities like Chiang Mai showed more interest in specific items like acne care. This kind of breakdown could help businesses market better in different regions.
