Bubblegum Kids,"Introduction

We’re excited to present the first official Pink Paper! We’ve designed this article to give insight into the current state of our project and a look into the future. The topics we will be discussing will be:

1) General Overview
2) Bubblegum Puppies
3) Bubblegum Dao & High Council
4) Bubblegum Land
5) Future Plans
General Overview

The Bubblegum Kids were originally minted on September 30th 2021 and we are so proud of everything that has happened with this project in under 90 days. This is a testament to YOU, the community!
Before we dive into the fun new details of what we are building, we want to provide an overview of the current Roadmap and provide a status report as to where we stand on the commitments we’ve made to the community.
The initial Roadmap we released had seven different objectives and we are near the finish line!
1. Establish Community wallet:
The community wallet has been established and currently has 28 eth. We will work on new funding mechanisms to provide a steady flow of funds into the community wallet.
2. Charity:
We have used funds that we’ve raised from the community to donate to charity. Giving back is a big part of the reason we’ve built this project to begin with. We strongly believe in helping others if we can and there will be ongoing donations moving forward.
3. Buy Land In The Metaverse:
We have purchased a 3X3 piece of land in the Sandbox and we have already started building!
4. Custom Merchandise:
We have made custom merchandise that has sold out. More merchandise is in the works and we can’t wait to see you wear them IRL.
5. Establish Bubblegum Labs:
Bubblegum Labs has been established and we’re excited to work with the DAO moving forward!
6. Free Mint:
The free mint is the Bubblegum Puppies, which will be available to claim within the next few weeks. Specifics of the Puppies can be found below.
7. Bubblegum Kids Comics:
We have started working on the concept and design of the comics!
Bubblegum Puppies
Even before the Bubblegum Kids were minted we had a vision in mind to reward all of our holders with some type of free mint. We really wanted to think outside of the box with this and we didn’t want to just release something that held no value. The question every BGK holder should be asking is:
Why should you claim a puppy?

The first objective in creating the Puppies is we wanted to make it known that the Puppies are not just companions to the Bubblegum Kids. Puppies are a freestanding project within the Bubblegum Universe that will provide utility of their own that cannot be obtained by only holding a Bubblegum Kid. One of the main functions of owning a Puppy is it will give equal voting rights within the DAO. The more Puppies and Kids you own, the more votes you will get within the DAO.
In addition to the Puppies voting rights, the Puppies will also get their own special place in the Metaverse. We are dedicating a section of our Sandbox estate to Puppy holders so they can run around and be free in their very own Puppy Park! We are in the very early development of our Sandbox land so we don’t want to give away too much just yet but the Puppies will have their very own role within the Sandbox.
Puppies will also be getting exclusive access to their own merch drops that are in the early stages of developments. We know a lot of our holders are puppy owners IRL so there may even be something in there for your four legged friends.
Another important part of creating the Puppies is we wanted to make sure we put just as much effort into the design and aesthetics of the Puppies as we did with the Kids. This determination was lead by our very own Warhol-In-Training, KingO Dawg. He has been hand drawing each trait one by one to make sure everything fits nicely together and is visually pleasing. On top of that, we want to make sure the look of the Puppies matched with the spirit of the BGK’s and I think its safe to say we accomplished that. Similar to the BGK’s we also threw in some very special 1/1’s to reward some very lucky minters. These 1/1’s have unique traits that are not available to any other Puppies in the collection.
The artwork for the Puppies have officially been completed and we are just putting the finishing touches on the backend items to make sure everyone can get their Puppies smoothly and efficiently.

How does the Puppy claim work?
The Puppy drop will function as a free mint to current BGK holders and there are 4 different stages within the process.
Step 1- Hold a BGK

The first step in the Puppy mint will be the snapshot. For those not familiar, a snapshot is where we will record all current holders of BGK’s during a specified time. If you are a BGK holder while the snapshot is taken you will qualify to claim a free Puppy.
Since our community is built around fairness and inclusivity we are allowing BGK holders who have their Kids listed to qualify for the free mint. As long as your Kid is not sold by the time the snapshot is taken you will qualify. Although we are permitting listed Kids to qualify for the free mint, we strongly suggest de-listing during the snapshot period to make sure your Kid doesn’t get sold before the snapshot takes place. As long as you’re a holder from January 4th to January 7th you are GUARANTEED to qualify for a Puppy.
The snapshot window will be January 4th- January 7th. The snapshot will take place at a random time between those two dates. The reason we are not giving an exact date and time for the snapshot is because we want to prevent people from buying up the floor a few minutes before the snapshot and dumping on the marketplace immediately after the snapshot. We feel that doing it as a snapshot window will be the healthiest method for our ecosystem without sacrificing the integrity of our project.

Step 2- Claim you Puppy
The next stage of our Puppy mint process will be the free claim period. This will take place between January 7th at 4PM EST and will go until January 14th at 4PM EST. Everyone who was a holder during the snapshot window will go to our website and will be able to mint a Puppy for free. The only cost to holders will be the gas price at the time. Most of you are NFT veterans by now but for those who don’t know, these fees don’t go to us, they go to the miners of the blockchain to process and validate the transactions. Gas fees fluctuate with traffic on the blockchain, so it’s good to check in to make sure you’re claiming your free mint with the lowest possible fees.

Step 3- Public Sale for unclaimed puppies
After the free claim period has ended there will be a two-day window where we will have a public sale for all remaining Puppies that were not claimed. Since claiming a Puppy is optional we understand that there will be some Puppies without rightful owners. There will be no qualifications to participate in the public sale and each of the remaining Puppies that DO NOT get claimed will be sold for 0.06 eth in the public sale. The 0.06 eth price is the exact same mint price as the BGK’s. We feel like this price both encourages new members to join to grow our community while also still providing value to our BGK members who were able to claim for free. To reiterate once more the 0.06 eth price only applies to Puppies that are not claimed. Puppies that do not get claimed and do not sell during the public sale will be lost in the Metaverse.
Step 4- Reveal Jan 18th
After the two-day public sale is open, we will be doing our big reveal where everyone who claimed or purchased a Puppy will be able to see which Puppy they got.

DAO and The High Council
The Bubblegum DAO is one of the most important announcements we have made to date and we are extremely excited to bring it to life in 2022. The reason we are creating a DAO is to empower our community to build and create value for our ecosystem. Together, we have built one of the strongest communities in this space and the team at Bubblegum Labs believes that giving our community complete control of our community wallet will help take the Bubblegum ecosystem to new heights.

What role will the DAO play?

Before we get into the details of the DAO we want to make it crystal clear that we will not be handing over the project to the DAO. We believe that our project is still very early and we have a vision and plan for the future. The Bubblegum DAO is a way for the community to help us build together and will independently run the community wallet. The DAO will vote on proposals that directly impact how to implement the funds in the community wallet. The Bubblegum DAO is the first step to turning a community driven project into a reality. We are invested in the longevity of this project and want to grow together.
How will the DAO work?
The Bubblegum DAO will allow any Kid or Puppy to be apart of it. We are aiming to set up the DAO for Q1 2022. We are looking at all avenues to do this, one likely option will be to issue governance tokens to each Kid/Puppy. Every Kid or Puppy you own entitles you to one governance token. Remember one Kid = 1 vote and 1 Puppy = 1 vote. The more you own the more tokens you get. These tokens will allow you to place votes ON CHAIN!

What is the Bubblegum High Council?
The Bubblegum High Councils primary role will be to create proposals to be voted on by the Bubblegum DAO. The High Council will be made up of 7 Kid/Puppy holders and will serve as your elected officials who will formulate ideas and create proposals that will be voted on.

How to become a member of the Bubblegum High Council?

BEFORE the DAO is formally created we will have the Bubblegum High Council elections, which will take place after the Puppy reveals. The goal of the elections is to make this process as democratic as possible. Your peers will be the ones electing the High Council, not Bubblegum Labs.
The elections will be a 3 stage process:
Phase 1: The Nomination Phase
The first stage in the process will be selecting who will be running for Bubblegum High Council. We will call this the Nomination Phase. We will set up a separate discord channel within our discord specifically for the High Council Election and we will notify the community of a window for when the nominations will take place. During this window members will nominate and declare their intentions to run for the High Council. All members who declare will submit their name into the discord channel. The other members will react to the nominees’ messages. The top 20 names with the most reactions will be nominated to run for High Council.
Phase 2: The Lobbying Phase

The second phase in the process will be the lobbying phase where the nominees will campaign to be voted into the High Council. We will provide a one-week window where the Nominees will lobby their fellow community and canvas for votes. We suggest they take to Twitter and Discord and let their intentions be known as to why they believe they should be elected to the High Council and what they plan on doing for the community. The role of High Council is very important because they will be the eyes and ears of the community and they will advocate on behalf of the DAO. Although the High Council cannot pass any proposals on their own, they will be responsible for listening to the DAO and putting forth important proposals that will shape the future of the project.

Phase 3: The Final Vote
After the one week window is up we will post the names of each of the top 20 Nominees in the Election Channel and each member of the community will get one vote (a reaction) per Nominee. The top 7 Nominees with the most votes (reactions) will be officially elected to the Bubblegum High Council. The High Council term will be active for 365 days. After the first term there will be a new election and this process will start all over again.
To summarize the voting system for the DAO is 1 Kid = 1 vote and 1 Puppy = 1 vote
BUT
The voting system for the Bubblegum High Council is 1 holder gets 1 vote per nominee.
*** Special note: Every member of the Bubblegum High Council will receive an Honorary Bubblegum Kid ***
The Bubblegum High Council proposals:
The Bubblegum High Council will be able to put forth proposals to be voted on by the community. In order for a proposal to be presented to the community it must have majority approval of at least 4 high council votes. The proposal then will be presented to the community and if it reaches the minimum vote threshold then it will move forward. The High Council will listen to the community to organize the proposals and put forward ideas that they believe will be beneficial for the community. But with any democratic process, if the proposal doesn’t meet the minimum threshold of votes, the proposal will not move forward.
More info on the logistics of the DAO will be released after the Puppies are minted but we are extremely excited to put these next steps in place to grow the community!

BUBBLEGUM LAND
The next big tangible initiative that we’re working on right now is creating Bubblegum Land in the Sandbox. We have fulfilled our Roadmap promise and went ahead and purchased an estate in the Sandbox. We have purchased a 3X3 piece of land in the Sandbox and have been assured by the Sandbox team that we will be considered a premium partner based on our geographical location within the Sandbox. This is great news because it means more exposure.
We also have contracted a great team of designers who specialize in building in the Sandbox. We’ve had a number of meetings with them and they have already started working on bringing our concepts to life. The land we purchased is fairly large so we will have a number of different areas within our land for holders to have fun and participate in different ways. Some concepts we’re developing for Bubblegum Land that are currently being built are a Castle, Candy Forest, Puppy Park, Gingerbread Village and more! Each area will allow our community to do different things and collaborate together.
The Sandbox is very new right now and we believe there will be a lot of changes to the capabilities within the Sandbox so we will reserve some space in our land to build future activities that might not be achievable now.
The Sandbox development team hopes to have our land completed within the next 3 months. We can’t promise since there could be hiccups along the way with such a new platform but we have faith in the Sandbox builders we contracted with. We are prioritizing quality over speed to make sure it’s created properly. We know 2022 is going to be a huge year for the Metaverse which is why we wanted to have a big head start in building a piece of the Metaverse. We see owning land in the Metaverse like owning an apartment building in Manhattan. The world is going virtual and we own a piece of coveted land in the Metaverse.
Future Plans
As we near the end of 2021 we also near the end of Roadmap 1.0! Roadmap 1.0 was centered on building our community and providing a foundation for our project. Roadmap 2.0 is going to center around building out the Bubblegum Universe. This project is not just an NFT project, we are building a global brand. Roadmap 2.0 will heavily focus on the lore of the Bubblegum universe. This includes a Bubblegum Comic and the much-anticipated portal.
We just want to reiterate how excited we are to build into 2022. We know this project was minted less than 90 days ago but we are growing so fast and picking up steam every day! We can’t thank our community enough for believing in us and allowing us to achieve so many of our goals so early. It truly wouldn’t be possible without the community. If you re-read this Pink Paper the word community was probably our most used word and that is because that is what we are truly here for. NFTs have given so many different things to so many people in the last year but for us its given us a group of like minded people that we consider family. We appreciate each and every one of you and we can’t wait to build with you all going forward.
#BGKTAKEOVER"
Citizens of Bulliever Island ,"The Rise of Metaverse
A science-fiction buff would tell you that Neal Stephenson first coined the word Metaverse in his widely acclaimed 1992 novel, Snow Crash, where people escape the dystopian reality to explore online spaces as digital avatars of themselves. The Metaverse not only mirrors the actual world in all of its three-dimensional complexity but also stretches our existential and creative foundations.
In October 2021, Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would undergo a significant transformation and position itself towards building virtual reality platforms. He said, ""We will effectively transition from people seeing us as primarily being a social media company to being a Metaverse company.""  Other tech giants have also expressed an inclination towards working on similar lines.
Does this mean centralized implementations of Metaverse could still allow interoperability and openness? Does this mean another age of web autonomy will be owned by a handful of companies?
What is an Ideal Metaverse?
Travis Scott's concert on Fortnite was just a 10 minutes event attended by tens of millions worldwide. Probably the only concert that happened through the lockdown, in which he appeared to be jumping from outer space. Is that a Metaverse experience? What do we mean by Metaverse, and what is an ideal metaverse?
Before handing over the keys to the Tech giants who have the resources to build the Metaverse - our digital life where we are going to spend an increasing amount of our time in the near future to rent-seeking value extracting platforms like Facebook and others, let's take a look at what the ideal Metaverse should look like.
We argue that the principal technology behind 'The Metaverse' should be Blockchain. Web3.0 enables digital property ownership on the internet with NFTs, enables humans to coordinate at scale with DAO's and enables participants to capture the value created through incentives like play to earn and create to earn.
A few decentralized games have inherited the founding values of the Blockchain industry, namely, security, censorship resistance, permissionless access, and decentralization. However, apart from governance and transaction management, user experience and a fair monetization model to establish a vibrant creator economy are critical too.
Emerging Metaverse platforms have an open-world nature, with their own utility tokens and a wide variety of lucrative collectibles. Blockchain empowers Metaverse capabilities to keep immutable records of virtual space creation, transfer of ownership of digital assets, and financial transactions.
The result would be an open economy that will uphold transparency and deliver a flawless and immersive user experience and offers fair compensation to participants for the value they bring to the platform.
Vision
Bullieverse is an Open Metaverse developed for the community of players and creators. It is built for the Web 3.0 citizen to have an immersive environment. As a result, gamers enjoy an out-of-the-world experience combined with a transparent and fair monetization mechanism that underpins our play-and-earn economy. Furthermore, it is powered by an easy-to-build 'low code' platform for community members creating and publishing games. The result is a high-quality gaming platform, where users come to both play and earn, but more importantly, experience it.
In line with the spirit of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO), Bullieverse will evolve into a community-owned Metaverse. This will be achieved as players and game creators start getting the Bull tokens. These fundamental principles set Bullieverse apart and make it 'The Metaverse,' and not just 'A Metaverse.'
Decentralized Governance
Immersive User Experience
Fair Compensation for users
Seamless Game Creation
Digital Asset Ownership
Bullieverse is built on a strong and loyal community base earned by high-quality experiences. Our community will be able to enjoy the following activities on the platform.
Play
Earn
Own
Experience
At heart, Bullieverse is a gaming ecosystem. But we believe in compensating our community for their time and loyalty. Our users can not only own NFTs but can also use the NFTs to play our games. Our asset owners can rent and lease their assets to others in the community. The Metaverse can also host events and experiences that our community can enjoy and cherish. In due course, we will also be able to interoperate with other Metaverse economies.
The launchpad for the entire vision would be through building a loyal and crypto native community that loves our dope NFT designs, immersive gameplay, and simple game creation mechanisms.
​
Foundational Framework
The Bullieverse vision would be achieved by executing our foundational framework elements. This framework provides us with the capabilities that underpin the decentralized metaverse built around a community of game players, creators, and asset owners.
A secure, scalable, and rich gaming platform built on Ethereum, Polygon, and Unreal Engine that provides game players and creators an enjoyable experience.
A suite of engrossing hand-crafted games that gamers play and earn from.
An easy-to-use 'low code' creator engine for game creators, and an incentive mechanism that rewards players and creators of games.
An asset-rich Metaverse for the community to own and monetize.
A gaming marketplace where players and creators interact and transact seamlessly.
To top it all, a Decentralised Autonomous Organization can ensure governance, and help scale the platform to deliver the vision of a virtuous self-reinforcing gaming environment.
The team executing this framework has several years of Web 3.0 experience as developers, authors, and investors. That allows the product to be crypto native in its truest sense.
​
Introduction to Bullieverse
Bulliever Island is an ever-expanding world with an arcade of games for the community to play and earn rewards.  It is an island that is about 3 miles long and wide. A game player can become a Citizen of Bulliver Island (COBI) by buying our Bull NFTs.
Game players can enjoy our first game, 'The Bear Hunt,' from Q1 2022. We are launching the Beta version of The Bear Hunt in January 2022 for our community. This is the first play-and-earn game that brings our community together. The Bullieverse platform is built with several futuristic capabilities in mind. Our communities will be able to do the following on the Metaverse.
Create Games
Publish Games
Play Games
Create Assets and
Buy and Lend Assets (NFTs, Land, Portals)
Our community can play the following roles on the platform
Game Player
Game Creator and
Asset Owner
Ecosystem Overview
This section elaborates on how the overall Bullieverse ecosystem comes together to create an Open Metaverse which is a living breathing organism that underpins several functions and interactions.
Players Rewards
Creator Economy
Curator Economy
Marketplaces
Asset ownership
Bullieverse Economy
What we are building at Bullieverse could redefine more than just the gaming landscape. In fact, we make the case that it has the potential to change how people interact with and perceive traditional socioeconomic structures like financial institutions, marketplaces, and governments. This is because A 

Tokenomics
Bullieverse has a dual token model, the Bull, and the Shell. Bull tokens are the governance tokens that are linked to key decisions and voting on resolutions, as the organization moves towards decentralization. Shell tokens are the gaming utility token that keeps the platform liquid and fuels the play-and-earn and create-and-earn economies.
This section talks about the different actors involved in tokenomics and how the attribution of value created by Bullieverse happens across these actors.
Flow of Shell tokens in bullieverse Economy
Shell token is the utility token used throughout the Bullieverse as the basis of transactions and interactions. It is an ERC-20 utility token built on the Ethereum blockchain, with Polygon being the L2 solution. It will be used across the ecosystem by gamers, developers, and publishers, allowing Creators and Players to exchange Assets and Games and build a user-based platform of rewards while developing an ecosystem where Creators and Players will share various truly unique gaming experiences. 
Bull Token
Bull token is the governance token of Bullieverse.
Interactions with Bull tokens are generally done by three actors. All transactions of Bulls across these actors will be on smart contracts.
Bullieverse Foundation: The foundation acts as the incubator platform for the creation engine. As a result, any assets created on the platform will share a portion of its revenues with the foundation via smart contracts. While the initial incarnation of the foundation is a centralized body, over the course of the next few years, we intend to become a decentralized ecosystem.
Staking Pool: This is designed to remunerate Bull token holders. Bull token holders who are also game players on the platform will have higher earning potential.
Bullieverse Treasury: This represents the Bulls that are owned by the foundation that comes from the proceeds of sales of DAO-owned assets with a 12 months lock-up. Proceeds generated through this Treasury will be sold back to the market to pay operational expenses.
Tokenomics
Bull Token : Distribution and Vesting
Shell Token
Shell is the in-game currency in the Bullieverse. Players will use Shell tokens to acquire in-game assets like weapons, special powers, health potions, skins, and other cosmetics. It will be used as the currency in the marketplace. Shell tokens will also be used for play-and-earn rewards and create-to-earn rewards.
The supply of Shell tokens will be capped at 1,000,000,000,000 tokens for the initial 5 years and will be used to fund the gaming economy. Shell token supply will be governed by the Community DAO.
Shell usecases


​
Citizenship
Users gain their citizenship on Bulliever Island by holding a Bull NFT. NFTs allow community members to play games with a 3D version of their Bull. 10,000 Bull NFTs were launched earlier in 2021, and are owned by over 2300 wallets. The design of the NFTs was done programmatically using 160 different traits for the bulls. 
This section describes the benefits and utility of owning a Bull NFT when community members engage and transact within Bullieverse.
Citzenship Tiers
COBI NFTs
NFT art has been both a booming economy and a dope trend on social media. Contemporary art patrons invest in one-off visual art pieces, that are sold just like masterpiece paintings. The second category which is part of the NFT buying trend, is NFT ""collections"", like COBI. 
Bullieverse is a collection of 10,000 uniquely and programmatically designed bulls, each one created with varying traits, like skin color, facial expression, clothing, horns, and accessories. We have used over 160 different traits in creating Bulls that will be used as avatars in Bullieverse games.
COBI Collection
Being part of the Bulliverse is not just cool, it also comes with a plethora of fun activities for the community members to do with their bull-buddies. Owning a bull makes them eligible to play games in the Metaverse, and earn rewards while you're having fun.
COBI NFTs can be accessed on OpenSea for now and would be available for trading on our marketplace soon. Our switch to Polygon as an L2 solution would be fundamental in significantly lowering the gas fee. 
Citizenship Benefits
Buying a COBI NFT instantly makes you a Citizen of Bulliever Island. It's possible to become a member of the Metaverse through a free pass as well, but it comes with limited access. Citizenship, complete ownership, and certain exclusive benefits are accessible only to bull owners. The benefits and utility of owning a Bull are as follows,
Play-and-Earn
Create-and-Earn
Own Land on Bulliever Island
Own Assets
Incrementally higher rewards via more NFTs or Shell tokens
Own a bull, and you gain foremost access to our releases - spectacular new games, bull properties, and infrastructure that is added to the Bulliverse space. All rewards in the Play-and-Earn category have significantly higher rewards for bull owners, enabling them to earn much more than other players. The potential of Play-and-Earn rewards further depends on the rarity of your COBI NFT and the number of bulls you own. These details are discussed in the Play-and-Earn section. 
The Bear Hunt Game: An addition to our Metaverse is the Bear Hunt game, which is again exclusive to COBI NFT owners. Winners of the Bear Hunt game will receive a Bear NFT. 
Land Grab: Land in the Metaverse would be sold in phases, and as bull owners are top-tier participants in the game, they get early access to the sale of land. 
NFT Marketplace: We plan to build a marketplace for the community, which would enable NFT holders to trade and rent their NFTs to peers. These would be loaned out for a specific period, and help other users gain access to certain exclusive events or games, or earn better rewards. 
Play and Earn
Play and Earn is a fundamental feature available to Bull NFT holders. Bulls will be the avatar of the game player for our initial games. Bear hunt which is rolling out in Q1 2022, is about the Bulls fighting the Bears to win the game. Winners will get a Bear NFT and Bull tokens as rewards. We also have a winners' board and have gamified the entire experience.
Rewards for holding the COBI NFTs typically depend on the below factors,
The Rarity of the Bull NFT
The number of Bull NFTs owned by the player
For instance, Bulls with claws are rare, with only 2.5% of the citizens on the island having them. Other rare traits include Laser eyes, Dagger horns, Crown, etc. 
​


​
Buy/Sell/Rent Land
As we roll out the availability of land on the island, users will be able to buy them. Early community members who purchase land will be rewarded with a lower price tag and/or access to prime and pristine locations on the Island. Land value will be determined by the ability to rent it for events. For instance, a beachfront could be more expensive than a dry piece of land in the interiors of the island.

​
Game Portals
Portals are spaces where games will be hosted. Community members can purchase portals and host games inside the portal, for which they can charge a fee to the game creator. The process of buying and selling portals is similar to that of a land transaction. However, land owners wouldn't be able to host games. A fraction of the fees charged by a portal will be sent to the DAO.
While the concept of portals would exist in the first rollout of Bullieverse (with the Bear Hunt game), this version of the portal would be owned by the DAO. We will be rolling out portal sales in alignment with the sale of land.
Creative Freedom
Game creation is not restricted by real estate limitations as they are generally based inside a portal. Portals, unlike lands, have no real estate limits, therefore, game creators have creative freedom to explore and expand their gaming environment. The exception to this feature is when community members decide to create simple gaming competitions on their land. In that scenario, they are restricted by the size, terrain and location of their land.
These are the aspects that a gaming experience would have within Bullieverse.
Fair Monetization 


​
Create Games
SnowCrash
SnowCrash is our game creation engine developed on Unreal Engine. Snowcrash leverages the full potential of Unreal Engine and the Unreal Engine marketplace. We provide Lego blocks consisting of assets, textures, materials, animations and more that creators can simply drag and drop. They can choose inbuilt game templates to quickly put together gameplay.
SnowCrash provides support for LUA scripting which can be used to write game logic and test the gameplay runtime. SnowCrash also includes libraries like Social Kit that enable social aspects like connecting with friends, chatting and following. SnowCrash will act as the abstraction layer between Unreal Engine's C++ libraries and the creator user experience.
SnowCrash has built-in plugins to enable in-game purchases and introduce incentive mechanisms like play-to-earn. Once the game is tested, creators can publish it to the sandbox for review and approval from the DAO. Developers can choose from thousands of assets in the creator marketplace to customize the gaming experience.
Creator UX will be provided on a simple user interface. Creators can get into this space and will see the assets that they can choose from. Once they have chosen the set-up of their game and the assets in there, they will be able to see the gaming experience that they have created. Once they are happy with the gaming environment and the plays, they can move it to the sandbox for approval.
SnowCrash - Creation Engine
SnowCrash will allow game creators with all the tools needed to create a game. The conceptual architecture of SnowCrash's starter pack for game creators is as follows. Game creators will be able to do the following as part of the game creation process.
Use Game templates (more details on templates to follow)
Customize Characters and Animations
Plugin Social Kit
Choose an Environment Pack
Add Particle Effects
Plugin to PvE AI
Use metadata APIs to access NFTs
SnowCrash : Bullieverse' Experience Creation Engine
Beyond this starter pack that is the most basic set of SnowCrash functionalities, game creators can also import from Land Assets and bespoke assets to enrich the gaming environment.



Non-exhaustive list of things you can tokenize
Once an asset is created by burning Bull tokens, they are sent to the curators for approvals. Post approvals, these assets are sent to the marketplace, where they will be available for the community members to buy and sell.
Buy and Sell Assets
Assets created on the platform, once approved by curators are available in the marketplace. Community members can buy and sell assets in the marketplace. When any NFT asset is bought or sold on the exchange, 5% of the revenues from the seller goes to the DAO.
Connect and Immerse
We believe that the social experience that our community gets in the Metaverse is as important as the gaming experience. Users can perform actions such as connecting with other members, either in the Open Metaverse or by being part of a community. Their connection with another member in the community will get them to be friends and allow them to chat with them or talk to them.
Community members will be able to see the games and the events that their friends are participating in, and will be able to set notifications to join their friends in these events. This experience will allow gamifying the whole Metaverse experience as friends start competing with each other in games.
Arcade of Games
The Bear Hunt game that is going through a Beta launch in Jan 2022, is just the first of our games. We have a roadmap of multiple genres of games that will help onboard a keen community of Bulls. The Game Arcade is critical to make sure that we have the demand to consume as our creator economy takes off in 2023.
Bear Hunt is an objective-based single-player game that is powered by Unreal Engine. Whereas, Treasure Hunt will be a multiplayer or a single-player game and Bull Royale will be a multiplayer game.
​
Bear Hunt
Bear Hunt is the first game that is being Beta launched in Jan 2022, and going live in Q1 2022. This is a single-player objective-based game where the winners will be rewarded with an NFT. This is a game where the Bulls fight the Bears with a special weapon.
The Bear hunt game has three levels which the Bulls need to fight and fire their way through. The Bears protect the outposts and the Bulls will need to defeat them to get past the outpost to the next level.

The game gets progressively more difficult through the three levels and at the final level is the game-boss that the Bulls need to defeat to win the game. Winners of the game will receive Bull tokens and a Bear NFT. 
Treasure Hunt
With Bullieverse, the gaming experience is as amazing as the game itself. Our Treasure Hunt game can be played in both single-player and multiplayer mode. 
In the single-player mode, as the game goes, the player will have to solve puzzles and identify the hops that will get them to the treasure.
The multiplayer game/event works differently. Players have finite time within which they will need to find the treasure. The person to get there first will win the tournament/event.
Bull Royale
Bull Royale is a multiplayer game - MMORPG. Teams of Bulls will be dropped into an island and will need to survive for a finite period of time. The team that survives the longest will win the game. 
Arcade Games
Arcade games will also be rolled out for those who are fond of this genre. Typically they are single-player games. The Arcade games we have in the pipeline are
Basketball and 
Bull Run
​
​
​
All the games will be rolled out one after another through 2022 and into 2023 and will be used to build the community demand for more games. This is to make sure there are enough game creators who would want to build cool games for our community of gamers.
Competitions
The social experience and interactions on Bullieverse are aimed to be as good as the gaming experience itself. Competitions are one of the ways we envision our community to come together.
Competitions will be created and hosted by Bullieverse Inc. in the initial days. Participants will pay an entry ticket to participate in the competition and a winner will receive a prize. Community competitions will be announced across the Bullieverse island for members to participate.
As community competitions get created by a community member, they will receive a percentage of the total pool for creating and hosting the experience.
​
Community Events
Community events much like competitions bring the members of the island together. They can be concerts, launch parties, movie premieres, or any celebration of music and culture. As community members spend more time online, this becomes the primary method of engaging with each other.
One of the key events of 2022 will be the COBI Annual Summit that will bring together the community with gaming competitions, prizes, badges, merchandise, wearables, AMAs and other community giveaways. As this feature matures, we expect it to be a viable and profitable means of engagement for artists and creative people in the Bullieverse. Apart from the pure commercial benefits, it would also create recognition amongst musicians and artists.
Technology
Blockchain 
Bullieverse is an Open Metaverse and built on the foundations of Web3.0. We use blockchain technology and NFTs to enable our network participants and community to be self-sovereign. NFTs enable digital property ownership on the internet. Each NFT is distinct or unique, it is indivisible and it is not interchangeable for another. 
NFTs
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) enabled a whole new dynamic where digital assets can be unique and scarce to create one-of-a-kind digital assets. NFTs are built on a cryptocurrency platform in compliance with Ethereum's ERC-721, ERC-1155 and ERC-1337 token standards. NFTs are units of value that are non-fungible, unique and digitally scarce which cannot be replaced by another equal part or quantity.
Below is the list of NFTs that are widely used in The Bullieverse ecosystem
ERC 721 

Game Engine
We use the Unreal Engine from Epic Games for developing games in our Metaverse. SnowCrash is our in-game creator engine. Bullieverse client can be launched through a browser call after authenticating with MetaMask or any supported wallet provider which loads up a specific developer-created game. This gives SnowCrash an interesting capability: Creators can place portals in our Metaverse Island which lead to other games. Our engine uses in-built Gameplay framework classes thereby leveraging the full potential of the Unreal Engine. The Gameplay Debugger is useful for watching real-time data at runtime, even on clients in networked games using replication. It works in Play In Editor (PIE), Simulate In Editor (SIE), and standalone game sessions, and all of the data is displayed as an overlay on the game viewport. Below is the summary of different layers of the Game engine.
Build: It consists of technology that solely processes assets and codes offline for the sake of generating the game build which is an executable. This makes our build process both effective and fast.
Networking: This mostly conducts the networking side of the engine, and the scene graph, which is how gameplay-level systems will access most objects and information.
Gameplay: This defines the behavior tree that gets used at a high level in the game, such as scripting and AI. This will also include an event messaging system. 
Tools: These are essentially the tools that will be used to debug and test the gameplay.
Core: This is a self-contained layer that provides the underlying foundations for everything including the audio engine and rendering engine. They are like the screws and bearing upon which everything else runs.
Architecture 
The Bullieverse platform architecture is composed of blockchain,  AWS-based cloud infrastructure to support our services, IPFS (Interplanetary File System) to store the in-game assets, and any other assets created by the game developers.  
When the creator publishes an asset in our market place it will temporarily get stored in S3 buckets, our minter service will deploy the assets onto IPFS and mints an ERC 721 NFT on the Ethereum blockchain using the metadata. This NFT will be transferred to the creator's wallet.
Below is the list of components that consist of the Bullieverse Technical Architecture.
Game clients
 The game client searches for existing game sessions, requests matchmaking or starts a new game session by communicating with the GameLift service. The client service makes requests to the GameLift service and in response receives game session information, including connection details, which is relayed back to the game client. The game client uses this information to connect directly to the game server and join the game. 
Services
We use our Lambda services to validating of NFT ownership. As shown in the architecture diagram, information from an external service can be passed to your game servers (via a client service and the GameLift service) without going through the game client.
Game servers
 Game servers communicate with the GameLift service by using the GameLift Server SDK, exchanging requests to start new game sessions, validating newly connected players, and reporting the status of game sessions, player connections, and available resources. Game clients connect directly to a game server after receiving connection details from the GameLift service.
GameLift service
The GameLift service is the core service that deploys and manages fleets of resources to host the game servers, coordinates how game sessions are placed across your available resources, starts and stops game sessions, and tracks game server health and activity in order to maintain game availability as player traffic fluctuates. Game servers that are deployed onto GameLift fleets use the GameLift Server SDK to maintain communication with the GameLift service to start and stop game sessions, report server health, exchange game and player data as needed, etc.
Smart Contracts
The smart contracts running on the blockchain include our asset smart contracts, ERC 20 tokens used for purchasing assets in our marketplace and ERC 721, ERC 1155 NFT contracts. Our services check for ownership of NFTs and populate the assets in the game session once the user successfully authorizes with the wallet. 
Security
Our marketplace relies on the security of the blockchain for the functioning of its smart contracts. We use a multi-signature wallet that uses the gnosis MultiSig wallet backed with five hardware wallets and need 3/5 signers to affect any change to the logic of our smart contract. Our Event tracker AWS lambda functions track the events emitted from the marketplace transactions (smart contracts) and cache them in dynamodb to keep track of ownership and exchange of assets and notify users on their registered email immediately after the transaction. 
​

​
​
Conclusion
Our journey has just gotten started; this is just a logical point to conclude the narration of the trip. Through this journey, we are super bullish to build an Open Metaverse, an app store for blockchain games, and most of all, a world-class gaming experience at Bullieverse - all focused on our community.
Except for an initial couple of years, Bullieverse will and can only scale through decentralization. That's because we believe our journey is all about community ownership. 
We bring the community together to earn, create unforgettable experiences, and continue to build for a more decentralized, more equal future for all.  
Go Bulls!
Challenges & Risks
Distribution
According to estimates from gaming research company Newzoo, ~2.8BN gamers play games on mobile phones compared to ~1.4BN on PC and ~0.9BN on consoles. Centralized control over mobile distribution platforms, such as the PlayStore (Android) and App Store (iOS), could pose a challenge for the peer-to-peer and user-centric vision of blockchain-based games. 
For example, Apple has historically charged development studios a ~30% distribution fee on primary sales of game assets. This has resulted in long-standing disputes with game developers such as Epic Games over the fairness and legality of such practices. However, Apple recently settled a long-standing class-action lawsuit with US app developers. Following the settlement, developers will be allowed to promote alternative payment options via email to gamers, thus potentially circumventing the hefty commissions charged by the App Store. 
Developments in mobile game distribution like these will be important to track over the coming years. Blockchain-based games ultimately aim to give developers and gamers full control over in-game experiences and economics, which stands in stark contrast to the platform-controlled nature of mobile gaming today.
Regulatory and Legal Compliance
Blockchain-based video game developers and users are subject to the same patchwork of laws and regulations that govern activity for all operators in the digital assets industry. And depending on the specifics of the individual games, they may also be subject to gambling laws and other gaming-specific regulations.
Tax Compliance
In 2014, the United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) issued a notice that digital assets (“virtual currencies”) are treated as property for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, all transactions, regardless of their size, are subject to capital gains tax. To date, the IRS has not taken a formal stance on the tax treatment of NFTs.

Overview
Introduction
As NFT owners, there are inherently plenty of questions surrounding our identity. Who are we? Who forms the backbone of our community?
The answer is indicative of the beauty of the NFT movement. The short answer; we don't know exactly who, exactly, comprises our community. We use our social platforms to express our unique personalities and stories through NFTs and artwork we purchase. We are not about fake likes, posts, and stories on Instagram.
We have a passion for what we do. We are all Incognito.
This collection consists of 10,000 unique “Incognitos,” randomly combined from tens of thousands of different possibilities. These NFTs live on the Ethereum blockchain as ERC-721 tokens. The only way to fully Go Incognito is by purchasing your own NFT, thus becoming part of the Incognito family. All 10,000 NFTs will be available for purchase, thereby expanding the opportunity to join our community. As founders, we believe in buying back the floor instead of reserving a certain amount upfront. We’ve also instructed our staff members not to mint any ICONs as we'll be purchasing them from the secondary market.
When creating the initial prototypes, our main goal with the Incognito collection was to elevate the design of our NFTs. We wanted our designs to have meaning, which is why we endeavor to create NFTs that hold real artistic value and quality that is unmatched in the community. To accomplish this reality, we set one simple goal: create something astonishing that is guaranteed to be remembered. We rather see them up on every collector's wall, instead of their Twitter profiles. Ideally, we would like both to happen!


3D-NFT Art
Over three months of planning, prototypes, designing, rendering, and brainstorming went into the creation of the entire Incognito collection NFT artwork. We strove for perfection, wanting to create something visually unique and well-executed. Our artwork is as important for us as our security, community, ERC-721 contract, and every vital part of this project. We are meticulous through every step of the design process.
2D-NFTs have typically been the norm in the NFT space. So far, not many artists and collections are leveraging 3D-NFT space, especially when it comes to collections of our size.
We are eager to explore the possibilities of the 3D space. Each NFT will have downloadable content that can be accessed through our website, providing collectors with access to 3D files for 3D printing, rendering, premade animations, and a full 6k resolution image of your Incognito.
We will continue to add even more utility & content for each NFT.

Special Rewards
These are the 7 special rewards that will be given out to the lucky Incognito holders of each unique 1/1 ICON NFT.
Introduction
A significant feature of the Incognito collection is the rewards we give out to fellow Incognitos. These rewards will range from numbered hoodies to $80k+ art pieces such as paintings, sculptures, drawings, and more. Our goal with these rewards is to give back to our community and help them understand how important they are to our movement. Our rewards are carefully chosen to bring elements of the digital and physical art world together. We accomplish this through a variety of raffles, events, scavenger hunts, giveaways, etc… as well as through beautiful digital and physical art.
*Note: All 10,000 NFTs are designed and created by Leonardo Fonseca, our Art Director & 3D artist. All physical rewards are created by the mentioned artists or companies. The Incognito NFTs are not designed by these artists/brands.
CryptoPunk 9709
CryptoPunk 9709 will be given out to one unique Incognito member who mints the unique ICON that represents this CP. This CryptoPunk is owned by the legendary Wilcox who has agreed to reserve it uniquely for the collection. We will be unlocking this CryptoPunk and making the purchase once we hit 25% sales in the collection. This reward will be given out 48 hours after the purchase is made. This is done to give the NFT owner some time to trade or sell his or her NFT to someone who might be interested in both NFTs. Once time runs out, we'll send the CryptoPunk to the address that owns the unique ICON. Everything will be announced and tracked through our Discord Server.
 
5 x LEGO Sculptures (By Nathan Sawaya)
These will be unique-looking ICONs made out of Legos. Previews will be posted on our website and social media accounts. Nathan Sawaya is the first contemporary artist to bring LEGO®, the world’s most popular toy, into the art world as a medium. His obsessive and painstakingly crafted work captivates viewers by its beauty and playfulness, combining innovation with a nostalgic feeling that brings one back to the possibilities of childhood. His ability to transform LEGO® bricks into interesting figures, devotion to scale and color perfection, and conceptualization of action of the subject matter enable him to elevate a basic toy to fine art status. (Avant Gallery). Nathan is the most famous LEGO® artist in the world. These sculpture rewards will all unlock once we hit 50% in sales.
 
Alec Monopoly Painting
As one of our favorite artists in the world, we are happy to include one of Alec Monopoly's paintings in our unique rewards pool. We have officially reserved one of his paintings from his famous Crypto Collection. We would like to thank the Eden Fine Art Gallery for making this possible. Alec Monopoly is an internationally renowned graffiti artist with over 1.2 Million Instagram followers. This painting will unlock once we hit 70% in sales. We’ll be purchasing the painting directly from the Eden Fine Art Gallery in NYC. We will include a professional metal print of your ICON NFT, and a uniquely designed hat & hoodie (1/1).

The Custom ICON pendant & chain will be unlocked after 100% of the collection is sold.
 
ICON Chain & Pendant
Metal Prints
35 Professional Metal Prints 24” x 24”

Prints are shipped flat, wrapped in glassine between foam core, between two pieces of ¼” plywood, shipped via Federal Express, next day standard delivery. Estimates include packing, shipping, and insurance to any Continental US location that is serviced (without any additional delivery costs) by Federal Express. We will look into the possibility of shipping these worldwide. Metal Prints will be unlocked after 80% of the collection is sold.
 
Master Collector 10 ETH Rewards
We will be rewarding a total of 10 ETH to the first person who collects one Incognito of each base type. We will be monitoring the wallets that might be close to completing this challenge.

Exceptions & Alternatives
All the details regarding the rewards unlock conditions, how to claim, and other information will be explained below. We'll keep this document updated in case anything changes.
Normal Rewards
All of the normal rewards have their own conditions for ""unlock.” We have also added the specific percentage goal needed to be reached in order to unlock. The specific details can be found on our “normal rewards” page. We expect to sell out in a matter of hours, but if this does not happen, we'll honor each of the rewards as we reach the specific goals. We will be giving everyone 96 hours (four days) to trade or sell their NFTs. After the four days are over, the owner/address will be able to claim the reward(s), all other trades after those four days are over will not change who can claim the reward. Claiming process for hoodies and hats will be started exactly four days after launch. This claiming process will be open for a couple of days, each NFT owner will need to send us their shipping information to claim their rewards. Unclaimed clothing rewards will be unassembled and repurposed.
 
UNLOCKS
- Once each reward is unlocked, we will announce it via Discord and all other social platforms. Each reward will have instructions on how to redeem it. For most rewards, we will require information such as shipping address, hoodie size, and other information. Incognito Hats will likely be delivered within 1-2 weeks, while Incognito Hoodies will have a 2-3 week lead time since they are ordered and manufactured after the launch and after all NFT holders have claimed their reward.
 
ALTERNATIVE COMPENSATION 
- We will try our best to ship worldwide but there will be some countries to which we will be unable to provide shipping. In the case that we are unable to ship a hat, hoodie, or metal print, we will provide monetary compensation or extra time to sell the reward(s) to someone in our community. This is something we will work on with each individual personally, to try and find a way to make shipping arrangements work.
Special Rewards
All of the special rewards have their own condition for ""unlock"" and production times.  Each reward has its unlock goal on the main information page. Since these rewards are significantly more valuable, we will be explaining the information for each in more detail below.
 
CryptoPunk 9709
- The CryptoPunk will be purchased as soon as we meet the 25% sales goal. We will give the NFT holder 48 hours to trade or sell his or her NFT in the secondary market. After 48 hours from our reveal have passed, we will make an announcement where we'll mention the winning address and proceed to send him or her the CryptoPunk. After the CryptoPunk is out of our wallet, we release all control over the NFT. If the NFT owner wants to resell both the Incognito and CryptoPunk as a bundle, we can help facilitate the sale. In this event, please contact us via Discord. If for any reason the original CryptoPunk owner is not able to deliver the NFT, and we can't acquire a similar type of CP, we'll be rewarding $60,000 as compensation.
5 x LEGO Sculptures
- Each Lego Sculpture will have a production time of two to four weeks. This timetable might change, if it does we'll make sure to announce it in our Discord. Owners will be able to trade this NFT until the sculpture is complete and ready to ship. We will make an announcement that will give the NFT owner 48 hours to trade or sell his or her NFT before we determine the winner and send that person the sculpture. We will cover the shipping fees to most countries worldwide. If for any reason, the artist is unable to deliver the art piece and we can't acquire a similar type of sculptor by the same artist, we'll be rewarding $15,000 as compensation.
Alec Monopoly Painting 
- The Alec Monopoly Painting has been officially reserved. We will be making the purchase as soon as the goal is met. Any time changes will be announced via our Discord. Owners can trade this NFT until the painting is ready to ship. We will make an announcement that will give the NFT owner 48 hours to trade or sell his or her NFT before we determine the winner and send that person the sculpture.

Royal whales are usually the biggest investors out there trusting the long-term visions of this project.

Technology
The technology behind our NFTs, website, security, proof, and other important information.
Incognito is an NFT collection issued on the Ethereum blockchain network.
ERC721 Standard
Metamask & Wallet connect protocol support
The minting process will work by using your web browser with Metamask wallet or through any wallet that implements the wallet connect protocol (Trust Wallet, Exodus, Argent, Rainbow, etc)
Provenance Hash
For each Incognito image, content is hashed using SHA-256 algorithm. A combined string is obtained by concatenating SHA-256 of each one in a specific order. The final proof is obtained by SHA-256 hashing this combined string, finally this is the provenance record stored on the smart contract.
Each Incognito token ID is assigned to an artwork image from the initial sequence with this formula:(tokenId + startingIndex) % 10000 → Initial Sequence Index
IPFS for metadata storage 
IPFS stands for Interplanetary File System, a decentralized File Storage solution Once a file is stored in the IPFS it cannot be changed / altered / destroyed / by anyone, not even the creator.
Our Website is built using the latest web3 technologies:
- Runs on a CDN (Netlify) with DDoS attack protection
- Vue.js as frontend framework, light, fast, and resilient
- Web3.js + Truffle.js
ICON Team
Our team information, details, and more.
Introduction
The most important part of an NFT collection or project is the team that runs it. This is why our first goal was to find professionals for each specific area of this project. In order to find the right person for the right job, our search started slow, but after some time and luck, we managed to bring together the best team we could have ever asked for. Our team spans the globe, from Australia to Argentina, and everywhere in between. Both individuals and third-party companies came together to make the Incognito vision a reality. We feel very confident in the combined expertise, professionalism, and passion of every member of our team.
Technology 
The core of every NFT collection is its technology. This is why we decided to look for a group of developers instead of one or two individuals common with other collections. We teamed up with a small company based in Argentina called Building Ideas by. A team of six individuals was contracted to work on our smart contract, the entire ERC-721 layout, web development, security, 3D implementation, much more.
 
Community Team
There is not an NFT collection that's successful without its community & following. For this, we have brought in a team of capable individuals who have experience managing NFT collections, discord communities, and general service support. We want to provide you with the best experience throughout this incognito journey. Every Incognito collector is part of something much bigger, a family, movement, vision, and more.
Media & Content Creation
All our content creation, media, and marketing are handled by Eden Media Group. This is a media & marketing agency based out of the Dominican Republic. The team has experience working with both local & international companies handling all types of needs that range from social media to cinematography productions. We decided to go the extra step and make sure all of our content was taken care of by professionals. 
3D Designs & Artwork 
All incognitos were designed by Nuxer.inc led by Nuxer, a self-taught 3D Artist and creative junkie with tremendous skills and passion. If there is one thing you will be amazed by in this collection, it's the amazing 3D models created by Leo. Over 500+ hours and two months of work went into the creation of all our artwork. The final result is an amazing combination of quality, attractiveness, and overall amazing 3D models. 
Web Design
Our web design was done by , a Web Design & Development Agency based in London. Their portfolio is filled with amazing work produced for top artists, companies, athletes, and institutions all around the world. They will be part of the Incognito family for the long run as we keep improving our website and start working on the next steps of this project.

Opportunity
Unique opportunity to be part of something special!
The Problem
The NFT community has been pouring millions into projects that have no real foundation or team with the professional experience to guide a multi-million dollar project. Additionally and rather unfortunately, other NFT collections often involve very poor artistic value. All of this means:
Collection dies off in a couple of days or weeks
Some people make money with quick flips but long-term holders aren't rewarded
Most NFT Collections have been lacking artistic value and quality
Many individuals are taking advantage of this community hype, resulting in quick money schemes instead of real NFT projects with a long-term vision
We believe this community is forgetting what NFTs should represent, pouring money into things that have no future value. We can and should do better as a community in general.
Opportunity
There is an incredible opportunity in the NFT community to create something that can be seen as an industry standard and change the way collections of this type are viewed. By building both a collection and a team that's focused on quality and real artistic value, we are hoping to create a brand that will be part of NFT history. The Incognito collection is just the first of many different projects we have planned for the future of Dyn Studios.
NFT Ownership
Intellectual Property Consumer Agreement
This Intellectual Property Consumer Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the “Agreement”) is made by and between Dyn Studios and the purchaser of an Incognito (ICON) from Minter (the “Purchaser” or “You” or “Your”). This Agreement becomes effective at the time you purchase an ICON. If you do not agree with any of the terms in this Agreement, your only recourse is to refrain from purchasing an ICON.
 
1) ICONs. The Minter has created or otherwise obtained all intellectual property rights to various different bases, characteristics, and attributes (each an “Attribute”), which will be randomly combined to create each ICON (for example, earings, eyes, hats, neck, body, face, mouth, and material attributes, and/or the like). No two ICON will comprise the same combination of Attributes. The collection consists of 10,000 randomly generated and unique ICONs living on the Ethereum blockchain as ERC-721 tokens. Ownership includes full intellectual & commercial rights to your specific ICONs.
2) Ownership. You will fully own Your purchased ICONs, as originally provided by Minter (Your “Purchased ICON”). In response to the Purchaser paying the price of a ICON upon initial release, Minter hereby sells, assigns, and transfers to Purchaser all right, title, and interest in and to Your Purchased ICON, and all intellectual property rights solely in the specific, complete combination of all Attributes included in Your Purchased ICON. As Purchaser will understand, one or more Attributes included in Your Purchased ICON will be included in one or more other ICON provided or sold to other purchasers. Accordingly, Purchaser cannot receive, and does not receive, any intellectual property rights in individual Attributes included in the Purchased ICON, or in any combination of Attributes other than the specific, complete combination of all Attributes included in Your Purchased ICON. Therefore, Minter retains all intellectual property rights in each Attribute, and in any combinations thereof, except to the specific, complete combination of all Attributes in Your Purchased ICON conveyed to You herein.
 
3. ICON Usage. You may use Your Purchased ICON for any lawful purpose. By purchasing an ICON, however, Purchaser agrees not to use the Purchased ICON in a manner depicting or encouraging illegal acts, or that is sexually explicit, libelous, obscene, violent, hateful, or slanderous.
 
4. Resale. You, of course, may resell or otherwise transfer your ICON to a third-party. By purchasing the ICON from Minter, however, You acknowledge and agree that all terms of this Agreement are binding on any subsequent owner and that you will bind the subsequent owner to all the terms of this Agreement, including this Section 5 (such that the subsequent owner must bind any succeeding owner to the terms of this Agreement, and so on, thus, causing all owners of the purchased ICON to be subject to this Agreement).
5. Miscellaneous. If any provision or any portion of any provision of this Agreement is construed to be illegal, invalid, void, or unenforceable, such provision shall be deemed stricken and deleted from this Agreement to the same extent and effect as if never incorporated herein, but all other provisions of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. This Agreement will be binding upon, and will inure to the benefit of, each party and their respective successors and assigns.
 
Behind INCOGNITO
The Story behind incognito and its vision. The story will take you through the thinking process and journey of its creator(s). Written by our founder.
Who are you? Yes! You, the individual looking at a screen right now... We don't know who you really are. Your Twitter friends probably don't know who you really are in real life. You are unknown. Just like most of the NFT collectors in our beautiful community. Just as the name Incognito suggests, we use our social platforms to express ourselves through NFTs we purchase, not through fake likes, posts, and stories on Instagram. We are all Incognito.
 
Incognito was born from a single word: quality. 
 
We want our community to stand for quality art and innovation. The main objective behind Incognito was to create something with the highest artistic standards in the digital world. When you purchase an Incognito NFT, we want you to feel visually attracted to what you are purchasing and appreciate the artistic value, not just the hype or trends around the project. Giving artistic value to our NFTs was one of our main priorities because it can't all just be about hype and trends, your money should be worth much more than just hype.
 
The story begins when one of my siblings asked if I knew what NFTs are. I had been part of the crypto world for a few years but I had not heard about NFTs yet. As an art fanatic myself, I didn't really understand the value of NFTs. I had the same questions many commonly ask. Why would I want something digital? Why can't I just take a picture or save the image on my phone? The questions were endless until I got into the NFT community and saw the amazing potential of this new type of ""ownership"" for the digital world. Just a few days passed and I was already part of a team that led an NFT collection, which grew to over four million dollars in trade volume in the first 30 days. Watching that community grow so fast and seeing the potential of creating something even bigger sparked my ambition to create the best-looking NFT collection. A collection backed by a team of professionals, a solid foundation, and the goal of connecting both the digital and physical art worlds through artistic drawings, paintings, and sculptures, all made with passion and real artistic value.
 
The journey to find the right team took quite a while, but with some patience and luck, I was able to contact Leonardo Fonseca, our Art Director and Head Artist. You might want to call it fate, but I was randomly followed by Leo one day and proceeded to check out his Twitter profile. To my surprise, I learned he was a 3D artist, exactly what I was looking for. After some further stalking through his Instagram page, I came across an old 3D model of a mannequin-type face. This was very similar to what I had envisioned for the Incognito collection so I DMed him and within a day we hopped on a Zoom call. I explained the entire Incognito project and vision to him, and to my surprise, the answer was an ""I'm all in”. Little did I know that a meaningless Twitter follow was going to bring me closer to my ultimate goal. The rest of the team also took a few days and weeks to bring together.
 
The name Incognito came from trying to find a good word to match with our mannequin-type faces that represent no specific individual. Just like a faceless NFT, most of you are faceless collectors, creators, and individuals that decided to go incognito by being part of this amazing but faceless NFT community.
 
 

"
Monaco Planer Yacht ,"INTRODUCTION
Our vision
For too long, a few large corporations have dominated the internet, meaning that we have
had less control, and even less ownership of our own data and creations. These
organizations have asked us to provide our personal data in exchange for access to their
platforms and services, that they have then monetized to advertisers for profits.
If you care about the possibility of regaining ownership of your personal data, you should
care about Web 3.0. If you wish to use a social media platform that provides equal benefits
to all users, you should be excited about Monaco Planet.
Monaco Planet is committed to becoming the leader on the next-generation SocialFi circuit
and playing an essential role in the road from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0 of the internet.
The short-term goal of Monaco Planet is to use blockchain technology to solve user social
pain points and put a series of critical web 3.0 features into practical applications. The
long-term goal is to become a new entrance to the high-frequency social activities of the
crypto population and thus to become the gateway of Metaverse.
We are here to build a platform together where you have control over your data, and get
rewarded by creating high-quality content.
Opportunity
When people talk about their “crypto journey,” it is usually full of wonder and discovery as
they plough into the philosophy of decentralization and the benefits of disruptive technology.
But for crypto amateurs, it can be bewildering and even dangerous, with scammers and
spammers floating in the space.
At the same time, it is hard for individuals and project teams to become opinion leaders on
their social accounts to attract lots of fans or to stand out in thousands of communities.
The current social media platforms are not explicitly for the crypto population.
Genuinely native crypto and NFT-dedicated social media platforms with a high density of
fans have not yet been born. And while there are over 100 million wallet addresses globally
and the number of crypto and NFT enthusiasts keeps growing every day, why isn’t there a
dedicated public opinion forum and social media platform for crypto communities?
PLATFORM FEATURES
Wallet login
Monaco Planet believes in “trust, but verify”. Users log in with wallets such as MetaMask.
Users can showcase their NFT collections on their profile pages, bringing another level of
trust in social relationships.
Users who publish and show their activities can follow each other throughout the community.
The platform also ranks users by influence and net worth of their NFTs. Based on shared
interests and beliefs in crypto, Monaco planet could foster organic connections among users.
Content mining /write-to-earn model
Traditionally, content creators’ content is owned by the platform, where ultimately the
attention of the audience is manipulated by an algorithm that creators have no power or
rights to influence over. Advertisers and the platform, instead of the content creator, who are
the backbone of social media, get the lion’s share of profit.
We are here to change that status quo.
As a SocialFi platform, the ownership and governance of Monaco Planet are determined by
the users themselves. By introducing the concept of “write-to-earn,” content creation itself
serves as a form of mining. Active content creators and discussion participants on Monaco
Planet continuously reap the benefits in the form of our native token MONA. The vast
majority of native tokens will be distributed to users who generate content, creating a form of
mining that is sustainable, inclusive and genuinely productive.
A more detailed description of the MONA token is explained below.

MONA TOKEN
MONA is the governance token of Monaco Planet and the utility token of Monaco
Ecosystem.
Allocation
There is a fixed limit of 1,000,000,000 MONA that will be issued and will remain fixed in
perpetuity.
Allocation plan is as follows:
55% of the fixed limit will be distributed to users through content mining and write-to-earn
model;
15% will be allocated to strategic round token investors;
20% will be allocated to the founding team and seed round investors;
10% will be reserved for ecosystem development;
Release schedule
MONA will be released in increments per the specific allocation plan.
MONA for token round investors will be released over a 2-year timespan in equal increments
at the end of each month.
MONA for the founding team and seed round investors will be vested and released linearly
over 4 years and delivered at the end of each month;
MONA reserved for the ecosystem development will be released in two batches: 5% in the
end of first month and the rest 95% will be released synchronously with the founding team
proportionately;
MONA for content mining will be released in weekly increments over a 8-year timespan;
The content mining output for the first week is 2,010,015 MONA.
Also to form a positive token price consensus, and reward active content creators on
Monaco Planet, we will align the schedule of weekly content mining output/airdrop with the
market price of MONA as follows:
Comparing the market price of MONA every weekend with the weekly average price of the
past week,
If it falls by more than 10%, the size of the weekly airdrop will be reduced by 10%
If it falls by more than 20%, the size of the weekly airdrop will be reduced by 30%
If it falls by more than 30%, the size of the weekly airdrop will be reduced by 50%
If it falls by more than 40%, the size of the weekly airdrop will be reduced by 70%
If it falls by more than 50% or more, the size of the weekly airdrop will be reduced by 90%.
CONTENT MINING
The first month
The first month, from November 28 to December 31, 2021, will be an invite-only period.
Users holding Yacht NFTs will be the first batch of users eligible to participate in content
mining.
Additionally, they can invite up to 5 users to participate in this initial content mining period.
On December 31, 2021, the first batch of seed users of the platform will withdraw MONA
obtained from content mining to their wallets and trade them on the open market.
The MONA distribution for the first month is weighted as such:
weight of Yacht NFT users = 1.2
weight of invitation code users = 0.3
The formula for scoring a single user every weekend is as follows:
single user score = weight x (number of followers per user/total number of followers +
number of likes/total number of likes + NFT net in the wallet/total NFT net value + number of
comment/ total number of comments)
The weekly distribution of MONA for single user will follow this formula:
MONA weekly total output of content mining x (single user score/total user score)
The second month and onwards
Starting from January 1, 2022, the platform will be open to all public users.
Users who stake MONA for at least one month will achieve a MONA staking weight, which
is necessary for participating in content mining.
MONA staking weight of single user = number of staked MONA/total number of platform
staked MONA
Four MONA staking pools are offered, with a different staking period of 1, 3, 6, and 12
months respectively.
MONA staking weight will increase by 10% for each increment in staking period, as in:
3 months = increase by 10% (x1.1)
6 months = increase by 20% (x1.2)
12 months = increase by 30%(x1.3)
On top of that, users who hold yacht NFTs will have an additional weight of 20% (x1.2)
The formula for scoring a single user every weekend is as follows:
Single user score = MONA staking weight x (number of followers per user/total number of
followers on the platform + number of likes/total number of likes + NFT value in the
wallet/total NFT value evaluated by floor price + number of comments /total number of
comments)
The weekly distribution of MONA for single user will follow this formula:
MONA weekly total output of content mining x (single user score/total user score)
Since then, MONA generated by content mining will be distributed in accordance with this
rule every week.
This MONA token distribution system is designed to encourage and curate organic creation
of high quality content on the platform. If a forged or robotic account is discovered, the
platform holds the right to terminate their content mining qualifications any time.
UTILITY OF MONA
1.Users participate in content mining through staking MONA, a write-to-earn model with
Proof of Stake (POS).
2. When the platform gains a specific user base and traffic, advertisers can buy and burn
MONA to achieve promotion posts, broadcast messages, and insert feed stream ads. (For
reference, Twitter's annual ad revenue is about 4 billion USD and Facebook averages in the
100 billion.)
3. Crowdfunding investment opportunities. Based on its traffic and user advantages, the
platform will obtain investment quotas for high-quality projects, which will be allocated to
MONA holders according to the proportion of MONA owned. Users can decide whether to
participate in the investment, but the quota will be guaranteed.
4. MONA can be utilized as a tipping mechanism for users.
DAO GOVERNANCE
1. As 55% of MONA is allocated to the community, Monaco Planet is mainly owned and
governed by the community.
2. MONA holders will have the right to put forward proposals and vote to decide whether or
not to implement these proposals.
ROADMAP
1. Blockchain technology and NFTs allow for the creation of digital items that are impossible
to duplicate. This created the concept of digital scarcity. Realizing the authentication and
demonstration of NFT assets, Monaco Planet brings another layer of trust into social
activities based on shared interests and beliefs. Monaco aims to become the leading
platform and hub for SocialFi, the gateway for all who wish to participate in the Metaverse.
2. With MONA tokens, Monaco Planet returns the ownership and governance power to
users. Monaco Planet will gradually decentralize content, data, and storage and ultimately
move to Web 3.0.
3. Monaco Planet will introduce more high-quality Defi and Gamefi projects to the platform
and community, allowing MONA holders to seamlessly connect social, finance, and gaming
into one cohesive Metaverse.

Each Super Creator is CHOSEN and individually gifted with unique skills & powers to fulfill a higher purpose. To assist with fulfilling this higher purpose all Super Creators have a secret access pass to the weekly ASSEMBLY where they gather to ACQUIRE more Knowledge, ENHANCE their powers and discuss ways to Manifest Miracles from the Meta World into the Physical World. Like in any reality, there will always be those who are called to seek and fulfill something beyond what meets the eye. We call them the seekers. Seekers may embark on a journey to find the secret behind enlightenment. The process of enlightenment will require one to find, acquire and activate all 7 major energy points within their system. When all 7 major energy points are activated they will awaken one of the 7 Divine and Legendary Energies. Those who manage to fulfill this will be the chosen ones for the greater mission and will have the Legendary access key to the CREATORS LAND. Only 7 divine energies can be awakened in this mission. Do you have the courage to step up and be one of them? When the Divine Feminie and Divine Masculine rekindle and connect to their soulmates they can fuse their Manifestation energies together to create a new being. From the same Divine Parents , the first born comes along in 90 days , the second born in 60 days and from then on , the same union can have their children every 30 days. Remember only 5555 divine creations can be brought in to existence from different Unions. Page | 6 The Creator’s Land will be the people’s land, a space for positivity, a space for healing, a place for the most beautiful and powerful spirits to come together to develop and contribute to the world beyond us. To fulfill this mission we must all come together in Oneness to manifest this from the Meta world into the physical world. ARE YOU READY? All wealth that is generated through this meta world will be put towards the birth of The Creators Land. The Creator’s Land will be a physical and sacred space that is the result from the hard work, vision and manifestations of the Super Creators. All Super Creators will have a 7 day access pass each year to the Land, for training, recharging and relaxation. They will also have a ticket to the 3 day Super Creators congress that will happen once a year, this is their opportunity to connect and re-unite with all 7777 Creators around the world, the chosen ones, to gather and discuss ways to bring more love, light and healing to the world. Page | 7 TOKENOMICS Let’s get down to how this all works. Tokenomics. How many NFTs are there? How many get minted? Do people own multiple NFTS? This project has 4 Categories of token, 2222 Genesis Model, which are the first generation of Super Creators. According to the Super Creator Legends, they have 7 major energy centres located within their bodies. From these 2222 Super Creators 49 will have activated 1 of their 7 Major Chakras. What does this mean? There will be 7 Super Creators who will have their Root Chakra activated (Red), 7 with their Sacral Chakra activated (Orange), 7 with their Solar Plexus Chakra (Yellow), 7 with their Heart Chakra activated (Green), 7 with their Throat Chakra activated (Blue), 7 with their Third Eye Chakra activated (Indigo), 7 with their Crown Chakra activated (Purple). If a holder collects 1 of each major chakras (a total of 7), then they will be able to create and receive a new Legendary Token. Once an activated chakra has been used to generate a Legendary token, it cannot be used again. The 7 Legendary Tokens which are the most rare and will only be created once a full set of 7 super creators with activated chakras (Root, Sacral, Solar Plexus, Heart, Throat, Third Eye, Crown) is collected and held together for a divine time period (explained in detail further in the WhitePaper). Next are the 5555 Babies which are the successors of the Genesis Model tokens. These tokens will have the same perks as a Super Creator but are the 2nd generation. Now comes the rare categories of Super Creators: there will be 22 Super Creator Leader Tokens. These are a special set of 22 tokens because they represent 22 special souls present on earth at this very time and space. These powerful souls are influencers and actively spreading positivity, love, light and/or healing into the world right now. These Super Creators will look exactly like their counterparts and if you are lucky enough to collect one it may even come with a few extra benefits and/or airdrops from these influencers. Collect one of these and you could be entitled to a lifetime of extras. Page | 8 How can token holders of the 2222 Genesis Models have the ability to fulfill their Babies (up to 5555 Babies maximum across all holders)? By holding one Masculine & one Feminine Genesis model for a minimum of 90 days. At this point, their 2 Super Creators can create 1 Baby. Thereafter, if the token holders continue to hold the same Masculine and Feminine Genesis Model Super Creator they will be able to generate a new Baby Token after a further 60 day period has elapsed. And then after every 30 days they will have the opportunity to fuse and create more 2nd generations until there are a total of 5555 Baby Tokens created. Baby holders will have the luxury of having access to the same benefits as the Genesis Model Super Creators, more details are mentioned further on in the WhitePaper. The public mint date of the Super Creators Is on 2/2/22 at 2:22 PM (UK Time). Prior to this auspicious day there will be the opportunity for our inner circle whitelisters to mint their Super Creators. There will be 1111 spaces on the whitelist, with all whitelisters having the opportunity to mint up to 2 Super Creators. If any Whitelisters for whatever reason don’t manage to mint all of their allocated tokens, then there will be the opportunity to mint these remaining tokens on the public mint date. When an individual collects 1 of each Activated Chakra, a total of 7 (one complete set), they will be able to generate a Legendary Super Creator. 1 of 7 that will be the most valuable tokens in this collection, not only because they are super rare but also because holding 1 of these tokens will allow the holder to have access to benefits that no amount of money can buy. These Legendary Perks will be revealed at a later date, but could include things like, having access to specific allocations of land on the 100 Acre Conscious Creator’s Land, Private Easter Egg access points within the Super Creator Metaverse, Launchpad Access, Insider Insights and Networking Opportunities with some of the leading conscious celebrities and much more. But all of this will be confirmed once the world is close to encountering one of these Divine Legendary Tokens. Page | 9 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND Super Creators by IAC were created by I Am Creator.

Page | 10 Roadmap PHASE 0 Preparations For Divinity The Super Creators are charging up and getting ready to descend on Earth with their Superpowers and Divine mission. At this point the holders of these Tokens will start to notice positive shifts in their life even before they are holding their Super Creator. PHASE 1 2222 Divine Super Creators Land On Earth On 2/2/22 Some of the Super Creators are divine male, while some are divine female 49 Super Creators have activated the powers locked within a specific chakra and are now beyond gender. If you are lucky enough to assemble a full set of 7 Super Creators with activated chakras from Root to Crown then you might be able to open the divine portals to the legendary realms. Universal laws dictate that there can only ever be 7 lucky humans in the entire World that will have the opportunity to open these portals. 22 Super Creators are unique Avatars that have incarnated as HUMANS! These 22 are leaders who have built up significant followings along their journeys to spread love, light and positivity in the world. Those that are lucky enough to hold one of these tokens may receive special benefits. Each of these Super Creators will be sent to different parts of earth to share their Superpowers in the Meta and Physical world. PHASE 2 5555 Divine Beings Will Be Born Out Of The Union Of Divine Male And Divine Female On 5/5/22 These Divine beings with their Superpowers are also able to give you access to the Super Creators Academy. Remember our Divine Parents (from Phase 1) can have Multiple Children with Different Superpowers. The First Divine Being can be born after 90 days of the Divine Parents being together. From the same Parents, a second Child can be born after 60 days of the first born and from the third child onwards, the divine parents can have a baby every 30 days. (Up To A Max total limit of 5555). Page | 11 PHASE 3 7 Legendary Divine Protectors Will Appear On Earth At The Point Of Singularity Of Time And Space In Phase 1, 49 Super Creators with activated chakras were dispersed around the world. In Phase 3, the 49 will converge to 7 sets of Seven. What does this mean? There are seven unique Chakras - Root , Sacral , Solar Plexus , Heart , Throat , Third Eye and Crown 7*7=49 ! This means that there will be 7 Unique Collectors of Superpowers who will gather all the 7 Chakras to form their Unique Set. With the merging of each set , 7 LEGENDARY DIVINE PROTECTORS will Descend on EARTH. These divine beings are the most powerful of all and will open up the Portals to the Physical and Meta World. PHASE 4 Into The Metaverse The Super Creators will create a Universe for themselves in the META world, where they will continue with their MISSION of Spreading Love, Peace and Harmony. All Super Creators will have access to our Meta-Land. Those that unlock the LEGENDARY Super Creators will have some Unique Benefits that will only be revealed later. PHASE 5 The Land Of The Creators The Super Creators will have special Access to the Land of the Creators. In Phase 3, the 49 will converge to 7 sets of Seven. What does this mean? The Creator’s land will be a place where you go beyond your limitations and enjoy the Freedom, the PEACE and BLISS with every Breath you take. At the end of every year all the Super Creators will convene at the Super Creators Congress for 3 days to protect the Metaverse. The LEGENDARY Super Creators will have special benefits in the CREATOR’S LAND (Revealed Soon). Page | 12 VISION This is the first spiritual NFT of this caliber and the plan is to continue providing as much value to the community as possible. Since the beginning of I Am Creator, our main focus has always been to empower the community by strengthening them with the skills they require to live an abundant life. The Super Creator project is the next step along IAC’s journey to make an even greater impact, to be able to empower even more people globally. Similarly to how valuable this vision is for the world, Super Creators by IAC will also naturally be extremely valuable. Firstly, with only 2222 Super Creator Genesis Tokens, there will be a low supply the NFT will be out of our millions of following I Am Creator and Master Sri Akarshana have. Our team are also real people who care and have been with the community for years. Additionally, there is value in all the perks and benefits that a Super Creator Token Holder will receive. Our mission is to actually change lives. The benefits of the token alone pay for itself as, by holding 1 of the Super Creators you will have access to I Am Creator’s Premium courses, programs and events that collectively are worth over Tens Of Thousands Of Dollars for FREE (for the duration that they hold the Super Creator Token), and this doesn’t even include the extra Super Creator training that will take place weekly to continue to build our Super Creators to achieve the highest purpose they came here to fulfill, with the guidance of I Am Creator, Master Sri Akarshana and the most successful members of our network. This training includes: Personal Development, Success Mindset Coaching, Business Strategies that have allowed us and our students to generate over 7 figures, Social Media blueprints that can and have generated over $30,000 every month, NFT & Crypto Education, Health & Fitness, Deeper Spiritual Practices & Teachings directly from Yogis in the Himalayan Mountains and much more. Page | 13 SCHEDULE OF SUPER CREATOR TRAINING As part of being a Super Creator Holder, you will get access to a wide range of programs mentioned above, but also additional Live training every week and even everyday. Why would we commit so much of our resources to daily training? Simple. For our Super Creators. Because we know that our Super Creators have a very Divine Mission to accomplish. And with the option to be trained in almost any area to achieve this, we know they will fulfill this mission much sooner than without. So our regular training consists of 2 things. How many things? Yes 2: SUPER CREATORS ASSEMBLE HANGOUT Every week, all Super Creators will assemble to align with their mission. During this weekly hangout, there will be new insights, training and guidance from I Am Creator, Master Sri Akarshana and some of our highest network. It will also be an opportunity for our Super Creators to Network. This Weekly Assemble will boost all Super Creators Mind, Body & Spirits, through consistent training to ensure that they are best equipped for the Super Creator mission. This Assemble Hangout will also be a place for all Super Creators to receive downloads that no one else will be aware of to continue this journey as efficiently as possible. Page | 14 24 HOUR TRAINING ACADEMY This is a 24 hours of sessions, including training and entertainment. As mentioned earlier, our goal is to equip super creator token holders with the tools, skills and knowledge necessary to live a prosperous, abundant and satisfying life. We want to help as many people as possible attract abundance and create the lives that they truly desire, to put them in the best position possible to help themselves, their loved ones and contribute into the wider world and/or universe. These sessions will begin from the 3rd March 2022 and will be accessible for as long as a Super Creator Token is held. Holders will benefit by having 24 Hour Access to these classes and seminars from I Am Creators lead coaches, trainers and mentors in a wide variety of fields. As mentioned above, there will be a wide variety of personal development training. But during these 24 hour sessions you can also leverage fun activities, such as singing, dancing, HIIT training, conscious movement etc. When you hold any of our tokens (Genesis, Fusion or Legendary) then you will have full access to the 24 Hour training. To access your training all you will need to do is go to www.supercreators.io, connect your wallet, and when holding at least 1 Super Creator in your wallet, then you’ll be able to access the ‘Token Holders Area’ where you will be able to find the details to join the trainings and sessions of your choice. We will be interacting with you in the metaverse and there will no longer be any issue with distance, especially in Phase 4. Page | 15 TEAM Super Creators By IAC has a global team working all around the clock to manage the hundreds of thousands of people (going onto millions of people) who currently know about the Super Creator Mission. In order to prepare everything for the Super Creator Launch, the team is packed with: Visionaries, International Speaker, Marketers, Content Writers, Influencer Managers, Crypto & NFT Experts, Multi Award Winning Graphic Designers, Life Coaches and of course a Spiritual Master. This is a growing team, with the sole focus of bringing even more Love & Positivity into the world. Every action or decision around this project revolves around 1 question: How can we make this the best for our Super Creator community? And with new team members bringing new expertise mixing with older team members (some of which have been with the company for over 10 years), we feel that this blend is bringing out the best not only for our Super Creators but also for the entire community. We are here to serve. Page | 16 CONCLUSION We know that anyone reading this, has been called to this project for a reason, whether you know what that reason is yet or not. We are here to assist with our Super Creators growth and development. And as you can tell, our main focus is the community. We have been reaching out and taking care of millions of our community members over the past few years alone. So making sure our Super Creators are extremely well taken care of, is nothing out of the ordinary for us. Welcome Home Super Creators…
"
The Lost Glitches ,"// The Storyline
1618 years ago, in the year 2134, humanity was doomed by an unknown virus that arrived on the planet Earth when the first expedition to Mars returned home. It was a team of 10 people that went to Mars, but only 6 of them made it back, unaware of the lethal and invisible enemy they had with them.
After several months, the whole world was affected by the virus, and millions of people died. No cure was found in time. It was deadly and unstoppable, as the virus attacked the nervous system by shutting down all the vital organs, one by one, making the victim die in agony. However, around 60% of the population survived and developed immune cells against the virus. These immune cells were called the “Pi Cells”, because of their fundamental structure.

Later in the year 1618 after the “RE:initialization” when “Pi Cell” was studied in detail, scientists developed a new technology based on its structure and on how it was communicating with other cells that would allow people to connect in “Deep Sky”, a new global virtual network that replaced the Internet. When “Deep Sky” was activated, an unexplained chain of events made people die while connected to the network. Their minds were permanently transferred into the network while their body stopped functioning. The culprit was quickly found. This event was triggered when a person stayed connected for 3 days, 1 hour 41 minutes and 59 seconds without breaking the connection. This effect was later named the “Pi Effect.”

The government decided to introduce a forced logout every 5 hour, thus keeping people safely connected to the network and making sure that no one will die again. Even if they tried to fix the “Pi Effect” quickly, people were lost in the depths of virtual reality, never to return again.

Lost Glitches is a fusion of collectible card game (CCG) and a role playing game (RPG). Players choose their syndicate, craft their deck and earn experience to improve their character’s abilities and equipment to eventually conquer the virtual world of Deep Sky.
At its core, Lost Glitches is a collectible card game, taking its cues from popular games in the genre. Players play in turns, casting their creatures and spells during their turn by consuming their available mana.To keep gameplay strategic and engaging, players can still cast spells during the other person’s turn.

// CORE PILLARS
In order to direct the development process we have conceived some Core Pillars of the game, these are tenants to follow during development. All decisions should strengthen these qualities in the game.

Role Playing
A feeling of inhabiting your avatar in a way that is mechanically and aesthetically relevant.

Competitive
Skill based to a point where it can reliably support contests with real world gravity.

Self-Expressive
Cards that are always relevant to the game and therefore allow for a wide variety of competition viable customised decks.

Aesthetically Distinct
A General look that makes it stand apart from other games in the Genre.

Constant player Engagement
Players should always feel active and should always have the possibility to perform an action regardless of turn.
Core Turn Structure
Every time a player performs an action the other player has an opportunity to respond to this action.
Players choose whether to take an action or pass. Then, priority passes to the opponent who gets the same choice – take an action or pass.
If both players choose to not act upon a phase, the game proceeds to the next phase.
Attacking
Players alternate turns, turns being defined by which player has the opportunity to attack with their summons that round.
A player can only attack with creatures when it is their turn.
A defending player can block attacks, attacking players can’t choose whom to attack.
The defending player can choose to block an attacking creature with multiple creatures if they wish, in this case the attacking player decides how the damage is distributed.
Upon summoning a creature it is ready to attack, there is no sleeping time for summons
When a creature has attacked it does not change state (Tapped/Untapped etc.)
Turn Phases
When there are no actions currently taking place ie no spells have been cast or attacks triggered, then players have the following options:
Summon a unit
Cast a Slow spell and/or any number of Fast spells or Character Spells.
Initiate an attack (if it is their turn to attack) 
When Combat is in progress, players have the following options: 
Cast any number of Fast spells or Character Spells 
Declare blockers (if they are being attacked)
The Stack: The last action performed by players is the first action to resolve in the turn phase.
Character Spells
Players can cast a “character” spell that costs mana. A player can start the game with only one character spell, which can be cast anytime (player turn or opponent turn). Once cast, it’s not available during the next turn.
Win Conditions
If the opposing player’s health reaches 0 the other player wins the game.
Players have the ability to surrender at any time without any negative consequence, or time constraints. 
Starting Cards
Hand Size on First Draw: Each player draws 7 cards at the start of the game. 
Mulligan Rules: At the start of the game players are given the chance to choose which cards they wish to keep. The rest are all shuffled back into the deck. There is no cost for performing a Mulligan. 
No additional card is drawn when the first turn begins.
Drawing Cards

Players only draw a card when it is their turn or if drawing a card is triggered by an ability.
The first player to attack does not draw a card on their first turn.
Action points/Mana
Players start with 1 Action point/Mana
Players receive 1 additional Mana to their pool every turn.
At the start of your turn used mana from the pool is refilled.
Your mana is not refilled during your opponents turn but you do receive an additional mana that is usable.
Time Limit
Phase Time Limit:During each action players have a 30 second time limit, if they do not perform an action during this time their opportunity to perform an action is skipped.
Timeout Limit:If a player misses 3 phases consecutively they forfeit the game.
Decking Out

If a player no longer has cards to draw then they takes damage directly to their health pool every time that they attempt to draw a card on their turn.
They take the amount of damage equal to the amount of times they have attempted to draw without cards ie. 1 damage for the 1st time and 6 damage for the 6th time.
Opponents cannot trigger this effect, it is only triggered when a player attempts to draw a card at the start of their turns. 
// Choose your play style
The game consists of five syndicates. Each syndicate is fundamentally different from the other. When a player selects a syndicate, they choose a specific play type that best suits their style. Specific creature abilities and character spells are found more often in one syndicate than the other, making that play style clearer.

ADAMANT HANDS (TROJAN)
A syndicate of glitches whose roots are of modern urbanism, network theory and decentralisation. Adamant Hands perceive Deep Sky as the amalgamation of cellular clusters of intertwined and highly functional enclaves. Their glitches start as solo fighters that gradually form ghettos who can take full advantage of the infrastructure networks of Deep Sky. Adamant Hands has a new vision of a gigacity, dense and systemic without segregation and borders.

Adamant Hand’s playing style is inspired by trojan viruses. Their attacks are stealthy and deal burst damage. Adamant Hands are strong in mid-game where the delayed damage of their trojan attacks and sacrifice takes effect.

CURATORS MAXIMA (DDOS)
A syndicate of glitches whose roots go back to shamans, hunting, tribalism and ecological management. Curators Maxima fetch glitches from the battleground and introduce a sophisticated system of resources management and sacrifice to introduce sustainability in the Deep Sky. They are fighting to expand their sphere of influence and preserve the ancient memories and traditions they accumulated in the real world on the Deep Sky Grid.

Curators Maxima’s playing style is inspired by DDoS attacks and worm viruses. They are strong in numbers and can spawn multiple glitches in one round. Curators Maxima are great in early game, able to take an opponent in a few rounds.

SENTINELS OF ETERNITY (CYBERSECURITY)
A syndicate of glitches whose roots go back to samurais, the bushido code and reincarnation. Sentinels of Eternity regard themselves reborn in the Deep Sky and not glitched. Their warriors are loyal to a practical and spiritual guide, having constant awareness of death and preparation for sacrifice to fulfil their calling. Their efforts to expand their sphere of influence on Deep Sky aim to achieve a transcendent state of freedom, serving the master who is the collective self.

Sentinels of Eternity have a defensive playing style, inspired by cybersecurity techniques. They can cast firewalls and sinkholes early on, staying protected while they gather mana to cast their own strong creatures. Sentinels of Eternity are great in long game sessions, able to deplete an opponent’s resources until they cast an unstoppable attack.

SONG OF THE CHAIN (RANSOMWARE)
A syndicate of glitches whose roots go back to mysticism, the occult and esotericism. Song of the chain glitches perceive themselves freed of social norms, beliefs and restrictions of the real world. Deep Sky provides the foundation for those glitches to bypass their false desires and habits and genuinely accomplish what they were meant to accomplish without expectations and motivation. Song of the Chain aim to abolish all other syndicates from Deep Sky, rejecting the existence of absolutes and establishing chaos as an agnostic attitude to achieve true will.

Song of the Chain has a passive-aggressive playing style, inspired by ransomware. Their opponent is faced with dilemmas to choose between two evils (e.g. lose a life or discard a card, sacrifice a creature or lose one mana). Song of the Chain has a weak early game attack, but if played right can accumulate to some serious damage quite fast.

GUARDIANS OF THE SOURCE (PHREAKS)
A syndicate of glitches whose roots go back to omniscience, tantric spiritualism, karma and systemic meditation. Guardians of the Source are pleasant when silent but are forced to awaken their most legendary and fierce glitches to protect the supreme entity, which is the networks of the Deep Sky. Through collective awareness, these glitches initially aim to stabilize the grid of the Deep Sky before revealing its true nature. Guardians of the Source recognise that everything is impermanent and that the competing syndicates disrupt the ultimate existence of an ever-changing essence.

Guardians of the Source have a defensive playing style, which uses the opponent’s power to their disadvantage, inspired by telecommunications hacking (phreaking) of the 1960s – 1970s. They are terrific in mid-game play, while they deplete and abuse the opponent’s resources from early on.

All cards in the deck have a mana cost. A deck consists of creatures and spells. 

Creatures can be cast only during a player’s turn and stay on the battlefield once cast. They can be used to attack or defend.

// Spells
Spells are cast once and are then discarded. There are two types of spells, only differentiation being when the player can cast them:

Plug and play spells can be cast anytime, also during the opponent’s turn.

Installation required spells can be cast only during a player’s turn.

// Creatures
Creatures can also be of a certain type (e.g. firewall, worm, trojan, etc.). Creatures of the same type might play stronger together and create combos.

Creatures always have a power and toughness value that define how strong their attacks are (power) and how much damage they can take (toughness).

A creature that has attacked a turn, can’t defend during the opponent’s turn. The damage a creature received is persistent across turns. A creature can’t attack or activate any abilities when first cast.

Creatures can have abilities, that are broken down in the following categories:

// Static abilities
These are abilities that a creature has, that are always on and can’t be deactivated.

// Activated abilities
These are abilities that require some kind of activation to be enabled. Activation cost is usually mana, but can be almost everything (e.g. pay with life, sacrifice a creature, etc.)

triggered abilities

These are abilities that automatically do something when a certain event occurs or a set of conditions is met.
// ULTIMATE ABILITY
These are the spells the player has on their arsenal. Although a player can have several spells on their arsenal, they can choose only one for a game session. A spell can be cast anytime and has a mana cost. These spells are upgradable while the player progresses in the game.

Spells aren’t powerful enough to help a player win a game, but if used strategically and with the right combination of cards they can give the necessary edge to win.
// DEEP SKY ENVIRONMENT
Each game, regardless if the player is playing against the AI or other players, will take place at a different location of Deep Sky. This might be at a square of the japanese district, in a restaurant run by one of the syndicates or at the top of a skyscraper. 

These battlegrounds will be shown from a top-down perspective, where the player will be able to zoom in closer to the action or zoom out and have a better overview of the playfield.

The battlegrounds won’t be static environments. There might be an audience watching and the battle will destroy the surroundings and might scare the audience away.
/ Modes
TUTORIAL 
During the tutorial, players play against an AI. There are 5 tutorial games that players have to play to unlock all other game modes. Each tutorial game represents a syndicate. Once the player finishes the tutorial, they become a Lost Glitch.

SINGLE PLAYER AGAINST AI 
These are training games you can play anytime. They are great if you want to test your deck, since ranking and experience aren’t influenced by playing against the AI.

MULTIPLAYER PVP
Players can play against each other. If you win a PVP game, you earn experience points which you can apply to your character and upgrade your spells and abilities.

TOURNAMENTS / EVENTS
These are competitive PVP games with an entry fee. These formats end after an amount of wins or losses with a reward based on results.
lay
Lost Glitches is a free to play PvP game. Players can also train in single player mode, but the game shines in PvP. When a player wins a PvP match, they earn “BITS” (our in-game currency).

Earn
Lost Glitches will host regular in-game events and tournaments where players can compete against each other. Participation in these tournaments has an entry fee in $LOST or in BITS. Depending on the type of event and the number of wins they achieved during the event, players can earn $LOST, BITS, NFTs, cards, booster packs and other cosmetic items.

Lost Glitches is not a pay to win game, so players participating in those events will never earn cards that aren’t available to all players.

Collect
Every player creates their own collection of cards. Players participating in the in-game events have the opportunity to also collect NFTs.

Trade
Players can join the game’s marketplace to buy and sell their NFTs.

Currencies
The game will have two currencies to have a clear separation between free to play and play to earn.

BITS
Bits are the in-game currency that player can earn just by playing the game. Players can use this currency to unlock packs, sleeves and other cosmetic items.

$LOST TOKEN
This is the Lost Glitches Token with a real world value. Players need to spend $LOST to join our in-game events and tournaments. By joining these events, players have the opportunity to earn more $LOST.
// $LOST TOKEN REWARDS.

It’s important to note that our game won’t contain any items that could give you an advantage over other players.

We are against any Pay2Win mechanics, and you will never see them in our game.
The $LOST token will be a regular, burnable ERC-20 token with an uncapped supply. It will have 18 decimals and thus will be divisible. The smart contract code will be published and verified as soon as our tech team has done their work. We’ll provide a sub-page on our website where glitch holders will be able to connect their wallets to then be able to call the $LOST minting function — for every 5 $LOST minted, 0.5 (10%) will go into a DEV fund.

// POLYGON TOKEN BRIDGE.
The Lost Glitches team will provide a token bridge which allows all $LOST holders to bridge their token to Polygon. On Polygon, it can potentially be easier to sell or accumulate $LOST tokens because the gas fee involved in trades is not as high as on Ethereum.

Q: Should you buy the $LOST token?
Important: The $LOST token should not be seen as a security token or as an investment vehicle.

It will be usable in the The Lost Glitches game later and can be redeemed for certain features/items. That way it can typically be classified as a utility token.

So if you own one Glitch, you will be receiving 1 $LOST token per day in rewards that you can redeem in the game or trade on a DEX (decentralized exchange).
Disclaimer: The following features are work in progress and might be changed in the future.

Q: What if I own more than one Glitch?
To answer this question, we need to circle back to the beginning of the article. If you own more than one Glitch, you will receive:

x1 Class NFT for each Glitch you own. (22 Maximum total of Classes NFT).
You can assign each of your Glitches to a Syndicate and claim its Leader NFT. (No Limits, each Glitch can claim the Leader NFT).
We did a snapshot of the wallets containing 10 or more Glitches today, November 08, 2021 and these wallets have been whitelisted to mint a free comic on the release day!

Snapshot was taken at this block: https://etherscan.io/block/13574000

NOW TO THE $LOST TOKEN.
The $LOST contract address is: 0x71854072ce51cC8859c8c178e33581034fa75753

As a special feature, collectors with more than 1 Glitch will be rewarded with minting multipliers.For example, if you’d hold 2 Glitches at a time that would allow you to mint 2 $LOST tokens per day. Now with the multiplier introduced, you’ll be able to mint 2 * 1.2 $LOST tokens so 2.4 $LOST tokens per day. The multiplier will be increased by 0.1 per additional Glitch held with a cap of 2x in case somebody holds 10 glitches.

Two more examples:

Holding 6 glitches = 6 * 1.6 = 9.6 $LOST tokens/day.
Holding 13 glitches = 13 * 2 (max multiplier) = 26 $LOST tokens/day.
// The Lost Glitches Comic.
We will release a maximum number of 10 000 comics. Minting price will be announced at a later stage, however, each 

Glitch Holder will receive a 25% discount and it will be free to mint for owners of the Immortals class.
The comic will be around 15 pages and feature the adventures of Ephira and Hoshi.

Glitch holders will have access to a 1 hour comic pre-sale before public drop.
// The comic booster.

In addition to the multiplier mentioned above, there will be an additional benefit for comic holders. Holding a comic in the same wallet will add another multiplier of 1.2x to the reward rate.

The following examples explain the comic booster:

Holding 6 glitches + 1 comic = 6 * 1.6 * 1.2 = 11.52 $LOST/day
Holding 13 glitches + 1 comic = 13 * 2 (max multiplier) * 1.2 = 31.2 $LOST/day
THIS WILL ALLOW YOU TO RECEIVE 20% MORE IN $LOST.
OW THE $LOST TOKEN CLAIM PROCESS WORKS?
To earn $LOST tokens, you must stake your Lost Glitches NFTs on the Ethereum network. Implementing a staking mechanism provides huge benefits for the project in long term even though it creates some initial gas-fee related draw backs.

To stake your NFTs, they must be transferred into a staking contract provided by The Lost Glitches. The contract will be deployed and verified on Ethereum so that it’s source code can be inspected on Etherscan. The staking contract and the deposit flow can be accessed through the official Lost Glitches website only.

Don’t use any other links or websites to connect with the official Lost Glitches staking contract.

Depositing the NFTs to the staking contract will unfortunately involve a gas fee. The gas fee should be somewhat close to what it costs to transfer a NFT to a different wallet. In addition, a one-time approval will be required which lets the staking contract maintain your NFTs. If you want to earn more $LOST tokens, you need to deposit more NFTs to the staking contract.

As soon as your first NFT is in the contract, you’ll start earning $LOST tokens. You can harvest them anytime and suggest leaving time for them to accumulate. The $LOST tokens will then be transferred to your wallet and you can trade them on decentralized exchanges or provide liquidity yourself.

// THE BENEFITS OF STAKING.
One of the benefits of the staking mechanism is that NFTs that could potentially be listed on Opensea can’t be listed for sale anymore when they are in the staking contract. This will reduce availability of Glitches and create more demand for for them. That means that everyone who believes in the Lost Glitches long-term and wants to earn $LOST tokens, is rewarded for not taking the chance to sell their NFT on Opensea or other secondary marketplaces and creates higher demand if someone chooses to sell.
"
Tools of Rock,"Technology
Tools of Rock is built on the latest Solidity version ~0.8. Since a lot of the contracts copy paste code, they end up using older versions that results in more expensive gas. Newer versions are much more secure and efficient in terms of gas, ultimately allowing you to get more for your money!

​

The best Solidity contracts in the industry today are of OpenZeppelin (“OZ”). All of the contracts use OZ but OZ has been changing quite a lot and came up with a lot of utilities. Tools of Rock leverages OZ's new stuff as well as the Counters library, Address library, etc. This adds to robustness of code (more secure, battle-tested and efficient) and separates us further from the pack as very few contracts are using these libraries.

​

Tools of Rock is setting the standard with its code with its withdrawal feature, further assisting the buyer securing their prized Tool of Rock.

​

Tools of Rock has conducted significant testing and recognize that the devil is in the details…so we pay a lot of attention to automated tests. For the basic features, we've built 208 tests (all passing). This level of detail and nuance is driven by our development team’s deep experience in the fintech industry, especially the payments space where testing is of utmost importance.

​

While many smart contracts in the market today strip out on-chain provenance we DO NOT do that. Tools of Rock believes that provenance hashes are very important for NFTs.

Uninterested Unicorns,"AN UNINTERESTING STORY AN UNINTERESTING STORY
Being magical and cute got boring so the unicorns started fighting to bring
excitement to their lives. But after a while even that wasn’t enough, so now
they’re just uninterested and blasé, isolating themselves in Uni Land away from
the rest of the metaverse.
Once upon a time, there was a wonderful land filled with butterflies, rainbows
and beautifully mystical unicorns. It was a Metaverse full of peace, friendship,
and predictability. Fortunately, our story does not take place at that time.
Because what kind of land could survive on these things alone? None, as it turns
out. As the years went by, the unicorns started to change. The lack of spontaneity
made them increasingly blasé. The friendships they made turned to ash once
they realised how similar they all were. It didn’t take long for them to crave
something different, something… dangerous. Or whatever could help pass the
time and make their lives worth living, really.
In the end, it seemed like conflict and self-promotion provided good reasons to
be alive. The society of unicorns divided into different clans, each clan asserting
dominance in one domain: fire, water, air, and earth. As they expected, creating
such a monopoly over the elements of life resulted in friction between the clans,
which soon led to wars. A pinch of vanity was key to pushing them over the edge
and really making them feel that, actually, they were pretty awesome.
Though rivalries were the norm, certain clans found themselves more
invested in fighting each other than fighting for resources. A group of
unicorns started seeing the others as competition, and delighted in
finding ways to remove some of their power and use it for themselves.
Piece by piece, they’d take away some of the light found in all unicorns.
As the victims became increasingly darker, the thieves became
increasingly purer, creating two new clans: the darks and the pures.
They’re pretty easy to spot, you’ll see.
After decades of feuds and narcissism, the current generation of clans
consists of Uninterested Unicorns. What once brought passion, skill and
reward is now met with a quick judgmental glance and a shrug. In fact,
the unicorns have secluded themselves in the Grand Valley, where they
can be free to be their uninterested selves without the whining of the other
members of the Metaverse. Why bother with basic matters, right? The
unicorns became practically impossible to reach, and it is even said that
the purest of the Uninterested Unicorns live in a majestic castle and
haven’t been seen in years…
The Uninterested Unicorns of the Grand Valley are the stuff of legends.
Despite this, each clan goes about their lives, completely numb to the
events that take place within the Metaverse.
That is, unless something seemingly interesting finally happens.

Questing represents the gamified experience
of Staking in our U_Unicorns metaverse.
The main rewards you can get from Questing for now
is UniCandy ($UCD), our first main utility token that we
developed specially for the U_U ecosystem.
Questing will become a core feature of our
Generation 1 Unicorns as it is the only way to earn
$UCD tokens before the game launch, and also
comprises of the highest percentage allocation in
our overall tokenomics breakdown.
Again, we would like to re-emphasize that questing
was designed with our earliest supporters in mind.

All Unis during Questing will be able to earn a base amount of 6 $UCD tokens per day.
One thing to note is that when Unis are sent on a Quest in groups according to
clans/rarity/longer lengths, they are able to earn an increased $UCD farming % to
their overall yield.
As of today, we have allocated around 125,000,000 $UCD tokens for Questing over
the next 5 years (25,000,000 $UCD / year distributed through Questing).
Any remaining tokens from Questing will be reallocated back to our
Foundation Reserves or the P2E economy, which will be decided in the
future as the project progresses and we monitor the state of our token

BYOPills,"BYOP
Blue Yellow Orange Pills NFT
White Paper 2021
BYOP embodies every aspect of our digital world vision - from both a technical
and artistic standpoint.
The future is a real time one -
Hence why we based our project on a real-time engine.
And set a stepping stone for a new digital world dynamic.
A dynamic that is bound by time.
A dynamic where experiences can be elevated
A dynamic where people see things from their own perspective
A dynamic where the rush of uncertainty is transferred to the digital world.
We want to introduce consumables to the metaverse.
A metaverse where your digital life can be altered in all kinds of different ways,
from visual experiences, to short term ability enhancements. Whether it be
recreational, educational , or even mentally medicinal - these consumables set
foundation for a new economy, of both creators and consumers - eventually
making the digital world a more dynamic place.
We're starting with our rst steps, where we alter the digital worlds with 10,000
pills, and begin the journey to achieve our vision in the near digital future.
OVERVIEW
•
•
•
•
•
•
BYOP is a collection of 10,000 unique programmatically generated 3D pills with the aim of being the rst consumable NFT across various
metaverses.
Aside from being aesthetically pleasing, the BYOPills will each provide a unique trip based on its traits in both AR/VR and eventually in
the Metaverse. We will begin with Augmented Reality experiences using our mobile companion app. The app connects to your wallet,
pulls your pills metadata, and crafts a unique AR effect based on those traits.
Our long-term vision is to integrate BYOPills with various metaverses & blockchain games, providing collectors access to in-game trips,
ability boosts, special emotes, or power-ups. This will drive demand and utility for BYOPills among different communities on the
blockchain.
Collectors will benet from added value as partnerships are announced, increasing utility and demand, and will benet from
consumable airdrops that can be utilized in a specic metaverse we have partnered with in the future. Furthermore, 10% of sale
proceeds will be used to purchase BYOPills below mint price, upon collector vote and approval.
BYOP benets from a deep and engaging storyline that will continue to develop alongside the project.
Each pill is randomly generated by combing over 170 traits with varying rarities across 6 categories including: Pill Cap, Pill Bottom,
Ingredient, Background, Aura, and Trip.
The pills are stored on the ETH blockchain and hosted on IPFS.

pills you hold, with their varying traits
and rarities. Initial app launch will feature
an AR camera experience exclusive to
collectors. This will provide each
collector a unique camera lens that will
represent their trip and will be based on
their pills traits. As the project and story
develops, more features will be
introduced including a mobile VR
experience.
Build the Facility
Purchase a parcel in
the Metaverse and
begin construction of
the BYOP Research
Facility. This will act as
our first entry into the
Metaverse and will
initially be a place for
BYOPills collectors to
congregate. Entrance
to sections of the
facility will be exclusive
to collectors. Going
forward, we expect to
build a Trip Room within
the facility, allowing
collectors to
experience their trip in
the Metaverse.
Allocate 10% of sale
proceeds to develop
community-driven projects.
This includes expanding
on the storyline, providing
new utility for BYOPills, or
both. Members of the
community will decide
what to direct the money
towards, including buying
pills below mint price. Pills
that have been purchased
will be used as giveaways
to reward those most
engaged in the community.
The option to burn them
will also be available upon
community approval.

Chibi Dinos,"Chibi Dinos began as a unique generative NFT project with traits assigned at mint. The first release of Chibis included a collection of 10,000 2D highly collectable, stylized creatures, each wearing the jersey of their in-game basketball team. 
The Chibis all play on one of ten different Dino themed basketball teams in the Chibi universe. Not content to simply dominate the Basketball Court, these Dinos have set their sights on the world.
The Chibi Dinos brand seeks to tie together real world perks, a robust digital landscape, and exciting play to earn gameplay into one cohesive universe. Leveraging an extensive network of athletes and partnerships, and fully realizing the potential of blockchain gaming, Chibi Dinos are positioned to be a first mover in the collectable NFT, sports, and e-sports markets. 
We aim to provide an immersive gaming and lifestyle experience that will be enjoyed for generations. In pursuit of this goal, Chibi Dinos will unroll a gaming ecosystem that spans 3 distinct, yet interconnected, modes of gameplay and participation that feature a multitude of opportunities to connect with and engage other players, compete, build community, and play to earn.
Play to earn opportunities include:
•        Competing in the Primal Hoop basketball game
•        Completing in-game challenges
•        Farming and exchanging SWAG tokens
•        Hatching and selling Chibi Dinos
•        Selling gear
•        Renting your Chibi Dinos for the draft
•        Staking a Legendary Chibi Dino to run a Bootcamp 
•        Participating in HOOP token governance/staking
•        Predictive Game
•        The Chibi Dinos Predictor Game (name TBD) is a first-of-its-kind sports predictor leveraging the Chibi Dinos NFTs. Through various gameplay mechanics, the NFTs will provide utility in the gameplay, where players can make predictions on NBA and other basketball tournaments, earning points by correctly predicting the outcome of multiple events throughout a game. Players from the Chibi Dinos community will compete against each other to climb up leaderboards and get promoted to higher Divisions for a chance to earn exclusive rewards and bragging rights, all while leveling up and adding value to their Dinos.
•        Primal Hoop
•        Primal Hoop is a Basketball and Adventure game that will be approachable yet deep, and appeal to all ages. It is divided into two distinct modes. This variety in gameplay will ensure that we have something to offer to a diverse group of players who are interested in different types of gaming experiences, all while providing a robust token ecosystem and multitude of play-to-earn opportunities. In this section we will highlight the 3v3 basketball portion of Primal Hoop, a competitive arcade basketball experience.
•        Gameplay
•        Mode 1 of Primal Hoop will offer a competitive arcade style basketball game. The gravity on planet Hoop is lower than that of earth and allows the Chibi Dinos to perform incredible feats on the court. The gameplay will include a simple move structure, with the ability to pass, steal, shoot, block, and perform special moves. 
•        The unique environment and way that Chibi Dinos move coupled with the gravity on planet Hoop allows for novel gameplay that will breath fresh air into the genre of arcade basketball. 
•        Players will have their Dinos compete basketball games of 1v1 or in teams of 3, and may have up to 2 Chibi Dinos on their bench. Games of Primal Hoop are either score based or time based with the highest scoring team being awarded the victory. 
•        Playing with a consistent roster of Chibi Dinos will allow you to increase your Team Level. Team Levels range from 0 to 100 and build as you complete games with your roster. These Team Levels offer a progression toward unlocking tokens, GULP potion to replenish benched Chibi Dinos, and occasionally gear.
•        Team Levels reset at the beginning of each season, and offer your Chibi Dinos an opportunity to grow together as a team and provides incremental performance enhancements as you progress.
The individual IQ of a Chibi Dino will influence the likelihood of a Dino successfully making a play in conjunction with the level of the team. As a Chibi Dino plays the game their stamina bar will reduce, forcing the most used Chibi Dino to slow down and rest. Stats from each game will be written to the blockchain and will follow the Dino around for the remainder of their existence. Tournaments and Play to Earn Adventure Mode
Mode 2 of Primal Hoop will allow players to set out on a quest to learn more about the world of planet Hoop, all while leveling up and improving their individual Chibi Dinos.
The adventure, story, and exploration offered in this mode will be significantly different from the arcade basketball action of the 3v3 game, but works in unison to flesh out everything from lore to new mechanics. In this mode a Chibi Dino will gain experience, level up, develop a skill tree, score rare wearable gear, generate brand new Chibi Dinos from eggs, and fight villains in their quest to find pieces of their demolished sacred moon.
As a player moves through the story and gains experience they will see their Chibi Dino grow from level 0 to level 10, participate in sacred rites, and develop techniques that will be handy in the 3v3 Primal Hoop basketball game.

Eggs
With the launch of the adventure game, Mode 2 of Primal Hoop, comes a new feature that will allow players to generate new Chibi Dinos to fill out their team's roster, as well as draft or sell their surplus Dinos to other players. 
Chibi Dino Eggs are produced at certain stages of a Dinos level progression with each Chibi Dino being able to produce 2 eggs throughout its career. The lineage of the hatched Chibi Dino will play a small role in its natural born IQ, with the final egg a Chibi Dino produces often inheriting some of the skill its parent cultivated throughout its adventures and career.
In order to hatch an egg, players will be required to pair a Dino to it to keep the egg warm, as well as spend SWAG tokens to hatch their new Dino. Chibi Dinos born from eggs will come out with no stamina and will require GULP potions for nourishment. 
A Chibi Dino hatched from an egg start at level 0, and is immediately given the opportunity to choose their destiny and decide on a skill tree to pursue. 


Classes and Skill Trees
As a Chibi Dino levels up in the adventure side of the game, they will have the opportunity to progress down a chosen class and skill tree. These classes present a fun and exciting way to shape the performance of your Chibi Dinos on the court, and offer a variety of options for team composition and strategy. Below is an outline of the various classes and a visual demonstrating how they act as checks and balances for one another.
Coach skills are naturally defensive and will help the Chibi develop defensive techniques that can counter offensive skills of other Chibis. This skill set will also provide a temporary bonus to Chibis that enroll in a Chibi Boot Camp that is hosted by a Legendary Chibi of the Coach skill tree. Chibis enrolled in a Chibi Boot Camp hosted by a Legendary Coach Chibi will get a temporary IQ boost for 10 games after they have left the Boot Camp (in addition to the permanent boost they get from training). 
Player skills are offensive by nature. These skills will translate to impressive dunk and trick shot abilities during basketball games that completely astonish non-defensive skill sets, but can be countered by well developed coach Chibis. This skill set will also increase your stamina in the game as well as grant a unique set of moves only available to execute in the Legendary Chibi League. 
Adventurer skills focus on ball movement, speed, and control. Adventurer Chibis will provide needed support, an answer to even the best defense, and assist in clutch plays. Chibis with this skill set will have the added advantage of being able to find cooler and rarer loot in Chibi Adventures.
Legendary Chibi Dinos
A Chibi Dino that has reached level 10 in the adventure portion of Primal Hoop will evolve to become a Legendary Chibi Dino. Once the evolution is complete the Legendary Dino produces an NFT trading card of themselves with all of their basketball game stats attached, and will no longer be able to play in the standard Primal Hoop (Mode 1) bracket. Any gear that is on a Legendary Dino will be locked to that Dino permanently, becoming its signature gear. Aside from getting an NFT trading card with market value, there are three core benefits to having a Legendary Chibi Dino: 
•        A Legendary Dino can be used to search Chibi Adventures (Mode 2) for rare gear that is only available to Legendary Chibis. This gear can be sold on the secondary market to generate income, or equipped by Chibi Dinos playing Primal Hoop or Chibi Adventures. 
•        A Legendary Chibi has exclusive access to play in the Legendary Chibi league, a separate bracket which will offer larger prizes and reward players in rare gear, HOOP token, or base Chibis. This will be a basketball game that is separate from Primal Hoop, but with similar mechanics. 
•        A Legendary Chibi Dino can be staked to a plot of land called a Gym and open up a Bootcamp. A Chibi Dino Bootcamp will allow low IQ Chibis to train, offering them a permanent boost to their IQ while generating passive income for the bootcamp owner.
•        Land, Gyms, and Bootcamps
•        Upon achieving Legendary status a player will be able to purchase land or a gym in Adventure Mode to open up a Chibi Dino Bootcamp. These bootcamps will allow the owner of the Dino to stake their legendary on a piece of in game real estate and earn fees from other players that seek additional training for their Chibi Dinos.
•        Most gyms will exist as indoor spaces, with highly desirable open air gyms available at various points on the map in Adventure Mode. 
•        Owners of Legendary Chibi Dinos and a gym will be able to denominate the fee for their bootcamp in either SWAG or HOOP. Only a select number of Dinos may occupy a gym at a time, so players are encouraged to price aggressively, purchase additional gyms, and level up multiple Legendary Dinos to provide training.
•        The IQ buff a Chibi Dino may receive from enrolling in a bootcamp is determined by the final IQ of the Legendary Chibi that has been staked to the gym, but caps at no more than 50 points.
•        
SWAG token will be a BEP-20 token. It is the primary reward incentive for playing Primal Hoop, and will be the first token that players can earn when the game is released. This token will have no cap on supply and will be used for a variety of consumable activities such as:
•        Naming your Chibi Dino and giving it a biography
•        Hatching Chibi Dino eggs
•        Purchasing lower quality gear
•        The fee for entering a lower tier bootcamp
•        Yield farming
SWAG will be awarded to players for participating in Primal Hoop, completing challenges in the adventure game, and as a fee for having their Dinos up for draft.
HOOP
HOOP will be a BEP-20 token and governance token. HOOP will have a maximum supply of 350,000,000 and will be awarded to players in key tournaments as well as in Legendary Chibi League games, used to buy rare gear, and used to train Chibi Dinos at the most exclusive Chibi Boot Camps. You will also be able to buy and sell Chibis for the HOOP token. Owners of HOOP can also stake their HOOP tokens to participate in the governance of the Chibi Dinos brand. This will allow members of the community to vote for changes in the game, such as tournament rules, gear drops, new lore and levels, brand collaborations, and the overall direction of the Chibi Dinos.
GULP Potion
GULP Potion will be a BEP-721 token that is inflationary and consumable. This token will be earned by leveling up your team in Primal Hoop, or found in Adventure Mode, and can be used to replenish the depleted stamina of a Chibi Dino. These potions will also be used in both the hatching and training process once Adventure Mode is released. GULP potions will come in a variety of quality levels with varying numbers of uses and stamina recovery, and have value on the secondary market.
Gear and Equipment
Gear is equippable for all Chibi Dinos that have not yet reached their maximum level and evolved into Legendary. 

Gear will give a boost to Chibi IQ, stamina, or both. Up to five pieces of gear can be equipped at one time. 
•        Head
•        Torso
•        Pants
•        Tail
•        Accessory
The primary source of gear will come through exploring in the Adventure Mode, completing quests, and solving in game puzzles. 
All Chibi Dinos can find gear, but only Legendary Chibis of the Adventurer skill tree will be able to find the rarest high-end gear. 
This rewards players for leveling up multiple Chibi Dinos and ensures a thriving secondary gear market. 
A second source of gear will come from artist and athlete collaborations, and exclusive gear mints that Chibi Dinos will release throughout the year. These will be limited edition runs with exclusively selected artist or athlete collaborations and will never be released again or replicated in the game. All gear will be sellable on a secondary market in the Chibi universe. 
The price for the gear can be denominated in SWAG or HOOP, but will generally reflect the rarity, looks, or boosts that the gear provides.
Chibi Dinos Economy and Ecosystem
Through carefully executed game and token mechanics that lend themselves to trade, Chibi Dinos will produce a deep ecosystem and robust in-game economy that empowers players with play to earn opportunities and a rewarding gameplay loop.
Each Chibi Dino will empower players within our ecosystem with a host of pathways to earn through the sale of Gear, Dinos, and training.
Marketplace and Wallet
Chibi Dinos have their own home for exchange and commerce. Our marketplace will allow users to buy and sell their in game assets, rent and lease their Dinos, and provide a direct outlet for the purchase of newly generated promotional content.
Players will be able to denominate their Gear, Dinos, Eggs, and GULP potions in either SWAG or Hoop tokens. The economy of the Chibi Dinos universe will be entirely player driven, and will be developed with their needs in mind.
Alongside the Chibi Dinos marketplace will be our wallet, used to connect to Primal Hoop and interact with your Chibi Dinos in exciting ways. Our wallet application acts as a home for your Dinos and tokens, and provides a gateway to everything from augmented reality experiences to accessing real world benefits lined up for our Chibi Dinos holders.

CrashTest Joyride,"BRAND OVERVIEW Crash Test Joyride (CTJR) is a contemporary art and streetwear-focused NFT brand delivering a message of positivity and self-expression. CTJR’s current product line consists of a collection of 4,444 hand-drawn and algorithmically curated pieces of digital art, including 15 one-of-one ‘legendary’ characters. Each piece features a crash test dummy ‘Joyrider’ base, accompanied by a selection of clothing assets such as shirts, jackets, hats and jewelery. The artistic intention is to infuse each character with a unique personality while consistently maintaining an overall air of confident swagger that their holder might also like to see in themselves. For CTJR, the art is not just an image, but a reflection of an individual’s best self. SAMPLES FUTURE DIRECTION Test Joyride is more than a one-off collection of digital art. In fact, we see our 4,444 Joyriders as the first ambassaders of what will become a broader cultural brand. We intend to move fluidly between the physical and digital realms, testing ideas and products through digital media, manifesting them into the physical through curated clothing and merchandise drops, and bringing it back again into the digital space. As a brand, we feel unbound by the restrictions of traditional definition.ROADMAP: FIRST STEPS With the successful launch of the genesis NFT collection, CTJR begins its move into the early phases of the roadmap. The first step is an immediate jump into the physical, with the introduction of our online merchandise store. At its launch, this will provide an avenue for all holders to exhibit their Joyrider in the real world through large format prints. The estimated release date of the CTJR online shop is 1-2 weeks post-mint. Following, CTJR will collaborate with high-quality clothing manufacturers to help bring its iconic designs into reality. Maintaining the quality and styling that Crash Test Joyride stands for, we will create the first of many limited release CTJR collections. This collection will be streetwear-focused and adapted directly from CTJR NFTs. Through this, we continue to blur the boundaries of a traditional NFT collection. Ultimately, the brand image of CTJR will be accessible in all domains. Ideal estimates aim to have our first drop ready by March 2022. Updates will be provided throughout the process. CTJR also aims to establish brand partnerships with select others that fit with our vibe and vision. These may include, but will not be limited to, NFT projects, influential figures, artists, media companies, and other clothing brands. The goal with these is to foster integration into diverse mediums, raise our production potential, and drive shared success. While we intend to extend beyond the NFT and crypto space, we do not forget our roots, and the WAGMI mentality that drives the space. ROADMAP: GENERATION II COLLECTION A generation II collection is a must for the CTJR brand. The potential creative extension and stylization possibilities that our Joyriders exhibit is too vast to avoid exploring. In tandem, we want to reward supporters of the brand. As such, all current CTJR holders will receive a Serum - a mint pass for our generation II collection that will transform and enhance their current Joyriders, infusing them with a distinct, but related personality. Importantly, this will create a second NFT, rather than replacing the one that you own. A generation II collection has to be done right, since we don’t want to oversaturate the CTJR space. MAYC set the bar but we are going to raise it. Expect the same creativity and swag that underscores the art of generation I. The estimate for the drop of this collection is late March to early April. FINAL THOUGHTS The NFT world is an explosion of creativity and positivity that has arrived unexpectedly. It is chaotic and beautiful, providing artists, developers, and brands with the means to bootstrap their vision. Combining decentralization, branding, and fashion, CTJR has burst into the NFT world with iconic style and imagery. We are the artists of Crash Test Joyride; you are the artists of your own life. Hello, you fool, I love you c’mon join the Joyride- The Crash Test Joyride Team"

How it Works
How 3DFrankenPunks Works?
Build an Organic Community 
We believe that our community is everything. A strong community is the backbone of every successful project. 
Through community sourced voting and approval process we believe that we can create value for all holders. 
Run Experiments
We are handing the Responsibility of Punksville and the ""FrankenTower"" vaults over to our community members. 
It is the right of all FrankenPunk NFT holders to put forward ideas in the form of ""Franken Experiments""
In order for these experiments to be a success they must first pass a rigorous testing phase 
Franken Values and Goals
•        Community 
Treat your fellow Frankens with respect. We are intolerant of negative and abusive behavior, we won’t hesitate to punish toxicity. When we are discussing proposals and the project’s direction, we should all maintain a high level of respect and understanding to everyone regardless of their opinions. 
•        Responsibility 
Responsibility is integral to the project’s future. Which is why we will be extra careful with how we use the funds and we will not be taking unnecessary risks that could jeopardize the project’s success. 
•        Experimentation 
From day 1 we’ve made sure to create milestones that are actually achievable. We will test and experiment new ideas before officially launching them. It is important to us that we validate our ideas before we allocate resources to it.
Responsibility of Holders
We are turning the responsibility for project direction over to our community through a governance process that allows for movement throughout the levels of governance. 
1.        1.
Citizen - Community Member
o        Holds a FrankenPunk & Proposes experiments 
2.        2.
Governor - Elected Official in Punksville
o        Holds a FrankenPunk and demonstrates leadership and the necessary skill to advance the project 
3.        3.
High Council - Founders/Core Team & Community Delegates
o        Multi-Sig holder and Executes ""experiments""
        Will hold elections for community representatives 
        Consists of 2 Governors and 1 Citizen with term limits 


Minting
What it is and How it works
10,000 Generative FrankenPunks @ 0.0888 ETH Each
Minting is the process of creating Dr. ETHvils monstrosities. Simply put, it is the contract that generates the FrankenPunks NFTs.
•        Fully randomized, over 90 traits and 5 difference types you can get
•        Fair distribution, all will buy-in at the same price
•        50% of the entire proceeds of the project are put into the DAO
•        Minting interface provided 

Community Governed Wallet
Accountability for Use of Funds
Community Resources
Since the time we have launched we have believed in the power of community sourced value. 
We have seen first hand what leading members of our community can do with examples stemming from design, development, Community Mods etc. 
Accountability over resources will be delegated to the community through the community governance process. 
Staking (Coming Soon) 
How to Stake Your FrankenPunk to gain Access to Punks Vault
What is Staking?
""Staking"" is a buzzword that you've probably seen thrown around Crypto Twitter (CT) and Discord a lot recently. Staking is the process of committing your assets for a period of time to support a project or protocol that you believe in. For early utility cases, in return, you typically receive passive income or interest on your staked assets. DAOs have added a new use case: governance.
DAOs have allowed users to stake their tokens and in return, earn more governance rights over the assets the DAO owns. DAOs use this model because a DAO's success is reliant on giving its most devout supporters the most control over the direction of the project. FrankenPunks will be using this method to grow and distribute our governance token.
How Can You Stake?
We will be implementing staking in Phase II as we work toward a proper tokenized governance structure.

Mission
The North Star of Punksville
What's the Point of Punksville?
Through the community managed wallet Punksville Members will be able to propose evil experiments, spend real ETH to implement them and advance Punksville across the world.
The purpose of the ""Punksville"" and the ""Franken Bank"" is to give emerging collectors access to one of the strongest and oldest collections in NFTs as well as direct governance over how community funds are used. Through purchasing and owning CryptoPunks and joining our community, you get real experience valuing, holding, and using the asset itself. 
Punksville Member is the collective term for any holder of a FrankenPunk NFT. 
Governance
How Decisions are made in the Punksville
How FrankenPunks Governance Works
This structure will serve as v.1 of what we intend to formalize under a community governance structure.
Experiments
The goal of governance is to pass the best experiments
Frankenpunks is structured as a community run project and with that citizens have the ability to put forward ""experiments"" to be run with the use of the ""Franken Bank"".
In order for a experiment to take place it must first qualify and pass the community checks. 
Dr. ETHvil performs the experiments, the community proposes them.
3 Pillars of Punksville
1. Proposals (Creating Experiments)
Community - NFT Vaults & ""Franken Bank"" Wallet
10,000 Citizens get to make proposals to the governors. Each NFT holder represents 1 citizen. One person can potentially have more than one vote if they hold multiple NFTs. 
2. Action (Performing Experiments) 
High Council – 9 High Council members review proposals that are on-chain, and either approve or veto the proposal. 
High Council members are made up of Ministers, one from each Principality representing each CryptoPunks Vault, 3 core team members (including Dr. ETHvil), and 2 representatives, one each from Governors and Citizens. Dr. ETHvil is the President of the High Council and shall ultimately run the experiments that are brought to the High Council or delegate experiments to the rest of the High Council and underlying Agents.
High Council Role – The High Council is not responsible for making proposals, but for executing proposals that are passed. 
High Council Agents – The High Council shall have the authority to appoint and engage Agents, Assistants, ETHvil Minions, and any other form of help to successfully run experiments. 
3. Dispute Resolution 
Dispute resolution is the final pillar of governance required to organize a long-lasting and successful community. The community makes proposals in the Legislative Branch, community proposals are acted on in the Executive Branch, but to the extent that disputes arise between Citizens, Governors, Ministers, High Council members or their Agents and Executive Organizations, a dispute resolution process shall be used to settle all disputes within Punksville. Any resolution reached by the dispute resolution process shall be final and will not have the possibility of appeal.
Proposals
What is Community Governance
On-Chain Voting
When consensus on a proposal is reached, an on-chain vote becomes activated. All 10,000 community members can participate and vote (equally), but citizens can also choose to delegate their vote to a particular governor or citizen (vote by proxy). In the absence of citizens delegating their vote through the voting platform or making a vote in time, that citizen’s vote will be automatically delegated to the Minister of the Vault that citizen’s 3DFP is associated with (see Principalities). On-chain proposals require a two-thirds majority vote approval. If an on-chain vote reaches consensus, an experiment is created and sent to the High-Council to approve or veto the experiment. If an experiment is vetoed by the High Council, the experiment will be deemed closed and any new experiments will need to be started by a new citizen’s proposal.
Community Wallet Votes 
If a proposal to use the community wallet funds has less than 50% of the community votes, it will automatically be delegated to Governors to vote, who shall be required to submit a vote on behalf of all citizens. If the vote is ratified, the proposed use of community wallet funds will be sent to the High Council to execute. If Governors are not able to pass a community wallet vote proposal by a majority, the vote shall be rejected. The High Council shall have the authority to execute approved proposals or to veto them back to the community, rejecting the proposal and restarting the community proposal process.
High Council Agents 
The High Council shall have the authority to appoint and engage Agents, Assistants, ETHvil Minions, and any other form of help to successfully run experiments. These Agents may be designated roles in different sub-entity structures, called Executive Organizations, such as development, creative arts, merchandise, sales, marketing, etc. The High Council shall have the authority, but not the duty to create as many Executive Organizations as they deem necessary to carry out the experiments.
Vault Proposals
How to manage community NFTs
4 NFT Vaults (4 Principalities) 
Each Vault represents a principality, and each principality gets one leader that they elect to represent them. Principalities will be managed by Ministers of the vaults. Ministers are tasked with running their respective vaults, and for acting as a representative delegated vote of any citizens who fail to participate in a vote on a proposal. Thus minister’s votes represent their Principality when citizens do not participate, and is a critical role which accounts for non-citizen engagement. Vault 1 represents 3D Frankenpunks 1-2500. Vault 2 represents 3D Frankenpunks 2501-5000. Vault 3 represents 3D Frankenpunks 5001-7500. Vault 4 represents 3D Frankenpunks 7501-10,000. Each Minister will be elected to serve on the High Council, shall be given a wallet shard, and can be removed by a two-third’s vote by the citizens in their Principality or by a majority vote of the High Council. Initial election of Ministers shall be made by the High Council, and each Minister of each Principality is required to own a 3DFP that corresponds to their Principality.
Vault Proposals
Citizens of each respective Principality shall be able to make Vault Proposals for the vaults their Principality holds to their Ministers. A two-third’s vote shall be required for their Minister to approve or reject a Vault Proposal. If a Minister approves a Vault Proposal, they shall have the executive authority to act on the proposal in accordance with the will of the Citizens of their Principality, except in issues where the proposal is to liquidate the vaulted CryptoPunk. In the case that a Principality Vault Proposal is to liquidate a vaulted CryptoPunk, the Minister of such Principality shall bring the proposal to the High-Council to be voted on for approval.
Actions
How High Council Governance Works
High Council 
The High Council is responsible for enacting experiments. 
9 High Council members review proposals that are on-chain, and either approve or veto the proposal. 
High Council members are made up of 4 Ministers, one from each Principality representing each CryptoPunks Vault, 3 core team members (including Dr. ETHvil), and 2 representatives, one each from Governors and Citizens. Dr. ETHvil is the President of the High Council and shall ultimately run the experiments that are brought to the High Council or delegate experiments to the rest of the High Council and underlying Agents.
The High Council has veto power over experiments as a check on the Legislative Branch, but its job is to ultimately run experiments and to employ agents and assistants to help run experiments at the will of the community. The success or failure of experiments is completely unknown, just as all science experiments are, but the direction of the experiments is completely directed by the Citizens, Governors, and Ministers of Punksville.
High Council Agents
The High Council shall have the authority to appoint and engage Agents, Assistants, ETHvil Minions, and any other form of help to successfully run experiments. These Agents may be designated roles in different sub-entity structures, called Executive Organizations, such as development, creative arts, merchandise, sales, marketing, etc. The High Council shall have the authority, but not the duty to create as many Executive Organizations as they deem necessary to carry out the experiments.
Dispute Resolution
How Issues are Resolved
Dispute Resolution 
Any resolution reached by the dispute resolution process shall be final and will not have the possibility of appeal.
Arbiters of Wisdom 
Arbiters of Wisdom shall make up the Dispute Council. There shall be 5 Arbiters of Wisdom selected by the community, with one being selected the permanent Arbiter of Truth. The Arbiter of Truth shall be none other than Dr. ETHvil himself, who shall be the permanent Chairman of the Arbiters of Wisdom and shall be the deciding vote in issues that are at a standstill. The remaining 4 Arbiters of Wisdom shall consist of 1 designated Citizen, 2 designated Governors, and 1 independent Arbiter, ElizabETH.
Dispute Resolution Forum 
Citizens may bring a claim for dispute resolution to the Arbiters of Wisdom, through the online governance portal. A citizen must formally announce the details of their claim in writing and provide all evidence to be analyzed by Arbiters at such time.

Osiris: The Metaverse,"Abstract.  Osiris  is  a  2d  metaverse.  A  living  breathing  virtual  world with  games,  currency  and  player  owned  assets.  The  avatars  of Osiris  are  known  as  Cosmic  Kids  which  are  ERC-721  utility  tokens on  Ethereum.  Osiris  is  decentralized,  being  developed,  directed, and  owned  in  part  by  its  community.  The  world  of  Osiris  is  known as  the  Nexus.  It  is  constantly  evolving  and  focused  on  fun,  classic, casual  games.  Osiris  is  creating  an  open  digital  platform  upon which  a  variety  of  experiences  can  be  developed.  At  its  core,  Osiris is  powered  by  the  crypto  currency  Opal.  Opal  aligns  incentives  of the  players,  community,  and  developers.  Items  earned  within  Osiris are  truly  player  owned  and  can  be  traded  in  marketplaces.  Above all  the  goal  of  Osiris  is  to  empower  players  with  play  to  earn  which rewards  engagement.
Gameplay  in  Osiris  is  focused  around  one  thing,  earning  currency  while  playing  fun,  classic games.  Within  the  world  of  Osiris  there  are  a  variety  of  game-pods,  mini-games,  and  other  in world  experiences.  Each  offers  different  styles  of  gameplay  focused  on  play  to  earn.  Currency  is generated  as  each  Cosmic  Kid  earns  passively  over  a  period  of  time  while  expending  energy. Some  games  have  passive  play  styles,  while  others  are  more  engaging.  Games  also  offer  a  jackpot which  is  rewarded  per  generation  of  a  specific  hash.  This  convention  is  implemented  to  keep currency  generation  fair.   Osiris  undergoes  regular  updates,  changing  to  showcase  the  most  enjoyable  and  popular community  created  experiences  and  content.  In  Osiris,  how  you  play  is  up  to  you.  You  can compete  with  friends  in  real-time,  play  multiplayer  classic  arcade  games,  attempt  to  gain  a  spot on  the  global  scoreboard  or  hang  out  with  others  at  one  of  the  many  social  experiences.  These social  experiences  include  events  such  as  digital  presentations,  DJ  sets,  interactive  NFT  art galleries,  and  more.  The  initial  launch  will  offer  over  20  different  game-pods  and  mini-games each  generating  the  crypto  currency  Opal.  Opal  is  a  cross  chain  ERC-20,  BEP-20,  Polygon  based currency.  This  means  it  can  be  converted  into  real  dollars  through  various  decentralized exchanges. Cosmic  Kids Cosmic  Kids  are  the  NFT  avatars  of  Osiris  the  Metaverse.  To  access  Osiris,  start  with  acquiring  a Cosmic  Kid,  a  unique  ERC-721  utility  token  on  Ethereum.  Cosmic  Kids  offer  benefits  such  as passive  income  and  voting  rights  in  the  DAO.  There  are  10,000  unique  Cosmic  Kids. In  the  future,  Cosmic  Kids  will  be  leasable  to  others  as  a  means  of  earning  passive  income. Cosmic  Kids  have  170  different  total  attributes  each  with  different  levels  of  rarity.  Together  this constitutes  your  Cosmic  Kids  rarity  score.  The  level  of  rarity  effects  how  much  energy  your  avatar has. Opal  Opal  is  a  cross-chain  crypto  currency.  New  Opal  is minted  on  a  daily  basis  to  provide  incentives  to reward  the  community,  developers,  landowners,  and players  of  Osiris.  Overtime  the  amount  of  new  Opal minted  daily  slowly  decreases  to  enable  positive long  term  growth.  Newly  minted  Opal  is  split between  game-pods,  mini-games,  and  landowners. The  Nexus  The  Nexus  is  the  main  spawning  area  of Osiris  and  home  to  the  most  popular  gamepods,  mini-games  and  other  experiences.  To access  fullscreen  games  your  Cosmic  Kid travels  through  a  portal  known  as  a  gamepod.  The  Nexus  also  contains  several  minigames,  and  other  experiences.  These  are accessible  directly  within  the  world.  Most mini-games  are  multiplayer  and  play  to earn.  The  Nexus  is  constantly  changing  and the  land  itself  can  be  directly  owned. Additionally,  developers  can  create  and import  their  own  experiences  into  Osiris.   Game-pods  Game-pods  are  portals  to  games  from within  the  Nexus.  These  games  are  casual  and  lightweight,  featuring  the  best classic  and  fun  gameplay  modes.  Each time  you  enter  into  a  game-pod  portal your  Cosmic  Kid’s  energy  is  slightly depleted.  Once  gameplay  is  completed you  are  awarded  Opal.  The  game-pods offered  within  Osiris  are  constantly changing  and  evolving.   Game-pods  have  an  external  display which  show  daily  top  scores,  unlockable NFTs,  daily  jackpots  and  screenshots  of the  gameplay  itself.  The  most  popular and  active  game-pods  are  featured  in  the central  location  of  the  Nexus.   Mini-Games Mini-games  are  experiences  that  you  can  play  directly  within  the  Nexus.    These  games  run  in real-time  and  you  can  see  other  Cosmic  Kids  participating  as  you  play.  For  each  round  of gameplay  your  Cosmic  Kid  is  awarded  currency  and  in  return  a  certain  amount  energy  is depleted.  Some  mini-games  are  more  passive  such  as  Fishing.  In  passive  games  the  quality  of items  used  can  be  upgraded  and  enhanced  increasing  your  earning  potential.  Other  mini-games are  more  active  such  as  Bash-A-Mole.  Mini-games  are  typically  multiplayer  experiences.  Some mini-games  have  a  maximum  capacity  in  which  case  Cosmic  Kids  can  queue  for  gameplay. Land Land  can  be  directly  owned  by  the  community.    Land  is  minted  as  a  NFT  on  Ethereum  and represents  direct  ownership  of  Osiris.  The  Nexus  has  2,100  parcels  of  land  which  will  gradually be  sold  in  waves.  Land  is  unique  in  that  it  grants  passive  income  on  a  daily  and  recurring  basis  to the  landowner.  Land  also  grants  super  voting  rights  in  the  Osiris  decentralized  organization.  This means  landowners  gain  the  highest  priority  in  determining  the  future  direction  of  Osiris.     Player  Items Player  owned  assets  represent  any  item  discovered, unlocked  or  earned  while  logged  into  Osiris.  These items  can  enhance  your  Cosmic  Kid,  for  example, upgrading your energy or increase your earning in a specific  type  of  game.  Osiris  offers  several  different types  of  player  owned  assets.     Conclusion Energy   In  order  to  earn  Opal  in  Osiris  each  Cosmic  Kid  needs  to  expend energy.    Energy  is  depleted  with  every  game-pod,  mini-game  or experience  a  Cosmic  Kid  participates  in  at  varying  rates.  Energy will  naturally  replenish  overtime.  However,  a  Cosmic  Kid’s  total amount  of  energy  and  the  rate  at  which  it  replenishes  can  improve with  items.   Osiris  is  a  platform  for  a  variety  of  gaming  experiences.  Initially  the  focus  is  on  classic,  casual gaming  modes.  This  wrapped  into  a  living  active  world  with  avatars,  events  and  more.    These experiences  offer  play  to  earn  and  are  powered  by  the  crypto  currency  Opal.  Initially  the  game client  will  launch  on  Android  and  iOS  and  is  scheduled  to  release  at  the  end  2021.  Osiris currently  has  a  functional  alpha  version  and  is  actively  being  developed  by  a  decentralized organization.  Osiris  is  focused  on  empowering  its  players,  developers  and  the  community  by featuring  play  to  earn  on  a  platform  that  offers  the  most  engaging  experiences  in  a  2d  wo

PX Quest,"INTRO
WHAT IS PXQUEST?

PXQuest is an NFT dungeon crawler, in which every character, piece of loot and plot of land are ERC721 tokens owned by the players. The game consists of four core activities:
●        Raiding/Dungeons/Questing
●        Dueling
●        Kingdom Building
●        Summoning New Adventurers
WHAT DO WE HOPE TO ACHIEVE?

We want PXQuest to be a completely free to play experience after the initial NFT purchase. This means no gas or hidden fees to play the game to its fullest extent.
For those with an investor mindset, we also want to deliver assets that grow in value over time and can be traded on the largest marketplaces. This paper provides a brief explanation of how we have balanced these often competing interests with a novel blend of technologies and game mechanics.
THE PLOT IN 72.1 WORDS

PXQuest adventurers are all that remain of once great kingdoms destroyed by a collapse in time in space. A calamitous war left most land in fractured time - uninhabitable by organic lifeforms. With the recent discovery of $CHRONOS crystals, these survivors can now stabilise time to reclaim land and summon objects and beings from the past. All that was lost can be regained … if new rivalries don’t get in the way …
KINGDOM BUILDING

Land

PXQuest Adventurers own land and join lands to form a kingdom. Land is minted on the Ethereum Mainnet, however structures built on land are minted on our layer 2 solution.
There are just 500 plots of land in PXQuest, comprised of two categories:

●        Time-fractured land (450 plots) - unstable land that requires 1250
$CHRONOS crystals to stabilise and mint before anything can be built upon it.
●        Stable Land (50 plots) - time-stabilised plots that are ready to build
upon immediately. These are unique 1:1 plots that will be auctioned for Ether prior to launch of the land system.
Before a plot is stabilised (purchased) with $CHRONOS the type of terrain is unknown. Different terrains, and different combinations of adjacent terrain, will give land different production abilities, stats and appearance.


What do I do with land?

There are several benefits to owning land:

●        Accumulating resources & alliances
●        Minting better gear for your raiders
●        Unlocking larger dungeon raids
●        Titles and Skins
●        RAIDING
●        
●        Players form raiding parties of increasing size to take on quests, dungeons and raids of increasing difficulty and reward.
●        Defeated mobs will drop weapons, armour, and resources for kingdom building.
●        Equipable drops will increase stats and victory odds for the characters assigned them.
●        All drops are NFTs in their own right that can be traded independently on common marketplaces like OpenSea.
●        
●        
●        DUELING
●        
●        On-chain dueling between players can be used to settle scores and wagers. Players can wager $CHRONOS, items, resources and more. Adventurer level, equipped items and choice of attack contribute to increasing the statistical odds of victory. The final outcome of duels is transparently determined on-chain where all can verify its authenticity and fairness.
Accumulating Resources & Alliances

Resources or raw materials are the foundations for kingdom building and crafting in PXQuest. Land plots yield layer 2 resources on a daily basis - depending on the terrain type. At the time of minting land, the player also specifies in the same transaction which Kingdom they wish to join. All landowners in the kingdom receive an increased resource yield based on the number of lands that are part of the kingdom.
 
Minting / Crafting Gear

During raiding adventurers will obtain resources they can use to develop structures on their land such as blacksmiths, markets and stables. These structures can be used by any kingdom citizen to convert resources and items into superior items (armour, weapons, consumables used in raiding). In other words, a strong kingdom produces rare non-character NFTs for players.
Raid Unlocks

Dungeons in PXQuest come in different sizes with the best loot obtainable in the largest raids/dungeons. To participate in raids of a certain size you must be a citizen of a kingdom with a certain number of structures built.
Titles & Skins

Land owners receive special titles and skins visible in game because they are after all… royalty!
I have no land! What about me?

PXQuest reflects a true feudal system in that the majority of players are landless. Landless players can however be invited to become the citizen of a kingdom, which entitles them to certain benefits. Citizens can:
1.        Join raids of the size unlocked by their Kingdom
2.        Contribute their resources to assist development of structures in the Kingdom
3.        Use Kingdom structures like blacksmiths to mint rare items for themselves
4.        Join private discord channels for their Kingdom.
5.        Do whatever else your Kingdom decides to build its community!
SUMMONING
Aside from land purchases, the other key use of $CHRONOS is summoning new NFT adventurers. With 750 $CHRONOS crystals and the blood of two Gen 1 adventurers, a player can summon an ancestor from the past. The race of the summoned Gen 2 ancestor is determined by the particular race combination of the two summoning adventurers.
On Top of this there is no hard cap on race variety out of the Gen2 collection. This essentially means Generation 1 holders will determine the rarity of Gen2 races by what races they choose to breed.
However, summoning does not stop there…

$CHRONOS
WHAT IS $CHRONOS?

$CHRONOS (aka Chronos Crystal) is an ERC20 token on the Ethereum Mainnet. that is required to perform summoning, evolving and reclaim time-fractured land.
The $CHRONOS token only has value within the PXQuest game ecosystem (1
$CHRONOS = 1 $CHRONOS). The PXQuest developers have no plans to make a secondary market for $CHRONOS.
GASLESS RAIDING

Using our hybrid asset model players can raid and receive loot without needless burning ETH on gas fees. Interactions are instead limited only where it makes sense as a game mechanic to prevent speed running - such as raid level requirements, boss cooldowns and adventurer revival cooldowns.

ON-CHAIN META RANDOMISATION
FAIR AND TRANSPARENT SALE

If you are reading this far it means that just maybe you care as much about doing things right as we do, and this begins at initial sale. Recent NFT launches have been dogged by claims of insider trading as developers had prior knowledge of the identity of the most valuable tokens during the sale process.
To prevent any possibility of insider trading we have implemented an on-chain meta randomisation function that will be called immediately following initial sale. Anyone can see exactly when and how randomisation has occurred, and nobody, not even our developers have any way of knowing the outcome in advance.
This mechanism will instantaneously make the updated ‘final metadata’ visible to all users upon randomisation, such that all market participants have equal knowledge.
 
EARNING $CHRONOS

$CHRONOS crystals can be claimed at a rate of 5 per day (unclaimed $CHRONOS accrues) per adventurer held. $CHRONOS yields will take effect immediately after initial sale.
SMARTER, CHEAPER ARCHITECTURE
HAVING YOUR CAKE AND EATING IT TOO

Despite the rise of technically viable alternatives, the primacy of Ethereum Mainnet NFT market is still undisputable - in terms of the number of market participants and value traded. However, steep Mainnet gas fees have prevented the growth of any substantively interactive on-chain gaming experiences.
So how do we reconcile this tension - between mainnet NFTs being the most valuable, yet also the most expensive to interact with?
Introducing our hybrid NFT architecture…

The Shiboshis,"SHIBA INU
ECOSYSTEM
WOOF PAPER
INTRODUCTION
Shiba Inu was the answer to a simple question.
What would happen if a cryptocurrency project was 100% run by its community?
While the term DeFi literally includes the word decentralized in its definition, this is in reference to economic status as opposed to its interral hierarchy. Our founder Ryoshi, said of our beginnings, ""We cre an exper i ment in decentraiized spontaneous community building(.,.)"".
While none of us could have imagined it at the time, this was the start of a revolution.
Projects built on the foundation of community involvement are the untamed wilderness of our future. As we move further away from rigid social structures and traditional mindsets, we become free to discover new ways to solve problems and relate to one another.
In a world ruled by the commodification of time, community-based projects are more than just a change of pace, they are a way to practice the radical acceptance of others. When success depends on the shared strength of the individuals who make up a collective, we are forced to shift our perspectives to align with those around us. The Shiba Inu Ecosystem is our way of recognizing the importance of tearing down a long-established paradigm of a formulaic success and building a path to freedom and creativity in its place.
A community is held together by hundreds, if not thousands, of interconnected moments. By studying those drawn to our project, we realized that true power doesn't come from a single perspective, it comes from working Together in harmony.
With that thought bright in our minds, we began developing the Shiba Inu Ecosystem in earnest.
WHY
DECENTRALIZATION?
We are standing at a pivotal moment in innovation.
Until now, centralization has been a prerequisite for all of our official structures. Political, educational, and financial systems are, and have always been, crafted in a way that does not equally and ethically distribute power to those functioning within them. There may have been times in history where this sort of internal configuration played an important role, but, in an age with the information of the world available at the click of a button, it's time to rethink.
2021 opened our eyes to how little control the average person has in the face of these overarching, generational structures when GameStop and AMC stock value exploded seemingly overnight. WallStreetBets tested the waters of what it would look like to disperse control to consumers and inexperienced investors alike.
It was inspiring, but it didn't last long. Just when the movement seemed to be on the brink of success, it was throttled by the bureaucracy of our centralized society. However, not before this concept of a new power among the people took root.
Months before any of these events made international news, Ryoshi was already setting his 100% community-based, cryptocurrency experiment into motion.
Cryptocurrency itself comes from the idea of disrupting routine and redefining how wealth can be acquired, which goes against traditional processes by its very nature. And yet, most, if not all, cryptocurrencies function within a system of enforceable rules. It's easy to see when we look back at cases like the SEC's win over the Kin Ecosystem (a centralized authority), or when we consider how the Binance Smart Chain seems to use centralized authority to offer ""benefits"" over their decentralized partnerships.
In the ever-shifting economic landscape, cryptocurrencies which do not take their independence into their own hands struggle with a tenuous existence. When the rules of the game are changed against their favor, they have no option but to comply; regardless of the consequences.
But not Shib.
OUR BACKGROUND
""You can only fight the way you practice.""
- Miyamoto Musashi
Ryoshi approached the creation of 	community f rom a unique perspective.
""W2 believe through the power cf collective decentralization we can build nmething stronger than a centralized team ever could create. A community-run •token is nothing without the united individuals who give it purpose.""
From the early days of Shib, we became known as the ShibArmy, both within our ranks and across countless other platforms. This wasn't just a nickname. For many, it became part of their identity. Whether you are a new recruit or part of the old guard, if you fly under the Shib banner, you must embrace our founding principles:
1.	We started from zero, with zero. It's the spirit of our project to create something out of nothing.
2.	We were not founded from an existing community, let alone a preassembled team. The brilliant minds behind Shib had never collaborated before. They were a fresh team of developers, designers, moderators, marketers, and shillers. When you joined the Shib army, from anywhere in the world, you found where you talents could be best used, and got to work.
3.	We love Shiba Inu Dogs.
We are proud of where the Shib Army originated and equally excited for our future. Our founder, Ryoshi, chose to start Shib from nothing, and handed the future of the currency over to our army. Starting with nothing means everyone has to bring something to the table. The holders and believers in our Shib Army have been the source of all our success. You and more than 544,000 fellow holders, admins, mods, leaders of international chat rooms, social media influencers, meme makers, shillers, and most of all, friends, have been the source of all our success.
THANK YOU. You are the real SHIBARMY, and we salute you! 
WHY
""To know ten thousand things, know one well.""
- Miyamoto Musashi
When comparing different blockchains, you might wonder why we chose to stay on the ETH network. The answer, like the rest of our project, is straightforward and purposeful.
Our founder, Ryoshi, embarked on the Shib journey with a predisposition towards ETH in the first place. It's already secure and well-established, and it truly allows us to stay decentralized (unlike some of the ""fad"" networks).
His top priority was to ensure that his project was free to change and evolve with zero outside regulations impacting it, and ETH was the way to achieve that goal. Our army is able to hold their own tokens in a wallet and collect payments from around the world, all while remaining independent of moderating forces.
Our founder also chose to send 50% of the total supply to Vitalik Buterin's wallet because, in his words, ""We sent over 50% of the TOTAL supply to Vitalik. There is no greatness without a vu:nerable point and as long as VB doesn't rug us, then SH?3i'- survive.""
These aspects of ETH are what made it the perfect foundation for ShibaSwap, a truly decentralized exchange where you can trade, buy, sell, and HODL to gain rewards which far outstripe the value of other staking platforms.
As ETH v.2 gets closer every day, bringing faster and cheaper transactions with it, ShibaSwap is poised to become the most popular and highest volume exchange with a laser focus on Erc-20 tokens and the Ethereum blockchain.
	ee%R'N, 	OF s*-ee
Like Ryoshi, the creator of Shib, Vitalik Buterin is a visionary. One of the youngest billionaires in history, VB is the 27-year-old co-creator of Etherium and, until recently, held half of the total supply of SHIB.
It's impossible to guess whether or not Ryoshi knew that exposing us to this ""weakness"" would actually become our greatest strength. Either way, on May 12th, 2021, VB used Shib to make history. In an act of astonishing empathy and altruism, he responded t? a humanitarian crisis on the other side of the globe by donating (one billion USD) of Shib to the India Covid Relief Fund.
The response wasn't entirely positive. Many believed VB had done the right thing from a moral standpoint, but that didn't prevent a wave of FUD from rippling through the cryptosphere. Even after the India transfer, VB still held over 45% of the total Shib supply, a fact which left investors fearful of potential volatility in the future.
Then, less than a week after making the largest ever crypto-donation, VB executed a record breaking burn, 410.24 trillion Shib (approximately 40% of the supply) were permanently removed from circulation, an amount worth more than $6.6 billion USD.
The implications for Shib were incredible. This wasn't done to shave off more zeroes so Shib could reach higher values in the future, this was a deliberate act which has already changed countless lives. VB was able to introduce hope to India when they needed it most.
This is the power of the ShibArmy.
SHIBA RESCUE W'TH AMAZON SM'LE
Shiba Inus are incredible dogs.
From the tips of their little teddy-bear noses to the ends of their curled tails, they are fiercely intelligent, brave, and independent, with an equal propensity for loyalty and mischief.
Sadly, the characteristics which make them extraordinary are the same ones which can make them a challenging pet. New or inexperienced owners can quickly find themselves overwhelmed and unprepared for life with a breed that's known for its bold (i.e. stubborn) personality.
That's where we come in. ShibaToken is more than just passionate about our mascot. Our community is actively searching for opportunities to help these dogs in the real world.
That's why we're showing our support by using Amazon Smile to seamlessly collect and distribute a percentage of your Amazon purchases to the Shiba Inu Rescue Association as donations.

SHIBA
INCUBATOR
Shib has clearly become one of the most successful, fully-decentralized cryptocurrency experiments in history. The ShibArmy was born from the concept that, under the right circumstances, talented individuals from all over the world will unite under one banner and use their unique skills to build something remarkable. While this is the foundation of the entire project, the Shiba Incubator (previously known as the Artist Incubator) is where we can truly allow these ideas to grow to their fullest potential.
What started as a traditionally creative space has changed and evolved, as does every aspect of Shib naturally through its design. The Shib team was tasked with discovering how to shift our focus beyond popular artforms (painting, photography, digital rendering) and discover ways to also honor ingenuity and individuality.
It is important to remember that art can be found in everything. There is the potential for creativity in every field, profession, and opportunity. Those who feel most connected with their inspired selves when they are solving complex math problems, repairing a car, researching technology, healing the sick, or any other example, shouldn't be excluded from those who discovered their passions through a more readily recognized medium. The prosperity of Shib is tied to our ability to openly include and encourage art in all its forms.
Decentralization, which will always be at the heart of Shiba Inu, is the future for more than just finance. In a world which rarely questions the arbitrary rules designed to benefit the wealthy and powerful, decentralization is the revolutionary answer which could reunite us with our lost autonomy. Those who understand the Shib experiment recognize this as just another way to help others step outside of preconceived limits and regulations to experience what it means to be part of our movement.
VISION OF SHIBASWAP
We are dedicated to building the best Decentralized Ecosystem (DECO) on the planet. Our three tokens were the seeds from which the Shiba Inu Ecosystem sprouted, and ShibaSwap is how they've dug in their roots.
The goal of éklUvÉwuv is to provide a safe place to trade your valuable crypto while remaining decentralized. We are loyal to our holders, and that gives us the means to grow exponentially. We will constantly scale this Ecosystem so it may bring everincreasing interested parties to the ShibaSwap platform.
Our unique tokenomics, solid design, technical implementation, and the viral growth from our good 'ole fashion memes, will reinforce the platform's strength and ultimately provide residual benefits to the Ecosystem.
Making a swap without a budget is a unique challenge, but by tackling various genres and product lines we will build a focused development team from the community.
We know that with our unified force, and the power of Shiba, we will be successful in advancing the Swap and Ecosystem as a whole, so that we reach new and spectacular heights together.
The best is yet to come!
STARTING TOKENOMICS OF SHIBASWAP
""You must understand that there is more than one path to the top of the mountain.""
- Miyamoto Musashi
Shiba Inu Token and the Shib Army have evolved beyond a simple experiment. As of the publishing of this document and the release of EVØäEWöV, we have become a Decentralized Ecosystem enriched by its own DEX.
This redefines $SHIB as more than it could ever be by itself, and is why Shiba Inu will out-perform, outlast, and outshine every crypto which attempts to emulate it.
ShibaSwap will highlight our three flagship tokens:
Shiba Inu: $SHIB
Leash Dogecoin killerl SLEASH
Bone: SBONE
On ShibaSwap your Shibas will DIG or BURY for BONE and other WOOF returns. The best trainers even teach their dogs to FETCH, which allows the pup to exchange one token for another token.
When Shibas DIG, BURY or FETCH, they generate WOOF returns that are distributed to the Puppy Pools.
 
-	When you EURY (stake) tokens:
You eurv	LEASH	BONE
You receive*	xLEASH	BONE
 
*These tokens are a representation of your share of the pool and will be automatically detected when you want to unstake your tokens through the BURY tool.
-	When you	(provide liquidity) you receive a SSLP token:
	LEASH	BONE
	Shib-Eth SSLP	Leash-Eth SSLP	Bone-Eth SSLP
These tokens are the SSLP tokens you will receive when you dig for our ecosystem tokens
These pools will then distribute rewards proportionally to holders of the aforementioned token pools.
While the staked tokens receive a fixed percentage of BONE, the SSLP pools are distributed as BPB (BONE per block) based on the allocation points to each individual pools.
Furthermore, certain DIG pools are eligible for DOUBLE or even TRIPLE rewards!
SHIBASWAP
LIQUIDITY EVENT
To get ShibaSwap off cn the right paw, we are having a two week Liquidity Eveni. During these 14 days, 1000 30NE per block will be minted for allocation pool user returns. After this, the rete will be reduced overtime with a decreasing algorithm.
During the Liquidity Event, 1000 BPB will be distributed to allocated farming pools through DIG. Additionally, 50 BPB will be minted and distributed to BURY pools,
 
and 100 BPB will be minted and distributed to Development wallet.
You can also bring your liquidity for selected pairs Uniswap or to receive part of the BONE returns.
BONE per block after the Liquidity Event:
100.00
75.00
50.00
25.00
ECOSYSTEM TOKENOMICS
""It is difficult to understand the universe if you only study one planet.""
- Miyamoto Musashi
$SHIB (SHIBA
SHIB came into this world as a puppy in August, 2020, and immediately began to change the cryptosphere. Since its launch, the Shiba Inu project has consistently broken the mold. We were the first to mint 1 quadrillion tokens, and the first to meaningfully ""burn"" 50% of our tokens to Vitalik Buterin's wallet. With the remaining half locked in Uniswap, we threw away the keys and started the ShibArmy.
Shib has been a trendsetter from day one. We were the first to allow diamond hands to hold billions, or even trillions, of our tokens in their wallets, as well as being the first spontaneous community building experiment dedicated to a decentralized structure. We earned the nickname DOGECOIN KILLER because the value of SHIB is primed and ready to overtake the value of Dogecoin. Even if SHIB never hits $0.01, between our publicity and our utility, SHIB will be worth proportionately more than the popular, canine memecoin.
Many have tried to follow our wagging tail, but the form and function of our project eclipses their hype. At the time of publication, SHIB is already becoming a household name. With a half-million holders, listings on 40+ exchanges, and international support, we are well on our way to our inevitable widespread adoption and implementation.
Now, Shib is the first cryptocurrency token to be listed and incentivized on ShibaSwap, our very own decentralized exchange, further immortalizing it in history forever.

$LEASH DOGECOIN KILLER
$LEASH is the second token in the Shiba Inu Ecosystem.
It was originally envisioned to be a rebase token tied to the price of DogeCoin. Later, it was decided that Leash would turn off the rebase function (the keys to allow rebase were burnt to ensure this) and continue as a simple ERC-20 Token.
SHIB was made to have an enormous supply (1 quadrillion tokens) with half locked away, whereas the supply of Leash is only 101,641 minted tokens.
Due to the low supply of tokens minted, the demand and reward for holding xLEASH and LEASH-ETH SSLP, will lead to a meteoric rise, similar to that of SHIB.

THE GRRR LIST
We believe being part of ShibaArmy should come with benefits. Benefits YOU receive.
For this reason, we do not allow wallets from unaffiliated exchanges to receive ANY WOOF Returns from ShibaSwap.
This Blacklist-style feature is exclusive to ShibaSwap, something we designed because several of the top SHIB wallets are from exchange platforms.
This GrrrList feature will ensure that holders on exchanges who want to access ShibaSwap returns won't have to worry that an unaligned entity might attempt to stake with their tokens and then freeze withdrawals.
Your wallet. Your returns- And to the CEXs„e GRRRRR!
THE FUTURE
OF SHIBASWAP
FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
To assure the longevity of ShibSwap and the Shiba Inu Ecosystem, a part of the minted BONE will be allocated to a multi-signature-activated Development wallet. This wallet will be split in 80%-20% during the first 14 days, then 50%-50%.
Core Developers & OG Admins Fund
This fund will be put towards the financial relief that our Dev team needs to make our Ecosystem their full-time focus. We want these talented individuals to continue building on the solid foundation they gifted to us with their own time, money, and energy.
This allocation will allow each of the volunteer developers to be both compensated for their initial investment into ShibaSwap, and also offer salaries so they can work exclusively in the EcoSystem.
The OG Admins are the veterans of the Shib Army, and they have all earned medals in Fighting Daily FUD and Fending Off Bot Takeovers. This fund allows the Dev team to have a trusted group of admins, deployed across multiple channels, to secure a safe space where Shiba fans build community without being bothered by FUD, scams, and other issues.
Shiba Inu Ecosystem Development & Marketing Fund
This fund will be put towards the continued advancement of our Shiba Inu
Ecosystem. Now that ShibaSwap is live, it is up to us to keep that momentum going. This allocation will give us the rocket fuel we need to send this puppy to the moon and beyond.
This funding will also allow us to quickly expand on concepts from the top secret 2021 RuffMap with a real budget. Upon the completion of RuffMap items, we will utilize the remaining funds to complete the projects confirmed by the Community Governance votes for 2022 and 2023.
The Shiba Inu Ecosystem is even more impressive when you consider that, so far, the entire effort has succeeded without spending a dollar on marketing.
However, this BONE PILE will allow the team to deploy international marketing strategies, such as commercials, that will make SHIB the freshest mainstream cryptocurrency name, sharing the ranks with Bitcoin and Ethereum.
MULTISIG MODEL
While Shib finds its greatest strength from its community, the Shib Team will always be here to oversee and support. In most cases utilizing BONE (our governance token) will offer the community a means to guide the Shiba Inu Ecosystem in accordance with the decentralized majority. However, there will still be times where it falls on the shoulders of the Shib Team to make responsible decisions in the best interest of the ShibArmy. When those instances occur, we will continue to follow our priority of fair and ethical practice by establishing multisig wallets.
Multisig wallets provides the ability to take assertive action while protecting from impulsive, emotional reactions. This means that the Shib Team will be ready to move quickly and calmly to a solution in the case of an emergency. Multisig wallets also allow the strategy leaders to make appropriate choices when it comes to allowing repayment of funds thus far, future development, and project scaling, with safeguards in place to ensure financial choices are always for the best of the overall community and not for personal gain.
The Multisig members are trusted members of the Community and the DeFi environment. There must be 3 out of 5 signatures for a transaction to be approved.
@Omega Hyperion, @Kaal Dhairya, @Hyroshy Kipa, @June Horla, @Sisley Argonaut.
Any emergency changes related to security or administration, must pass the Emergency Multisig with at least 6 out of 9 signatures.

RUFFMAP
Our roadmap will remain top secret to ensure our continued advantage in this highly competitive space, but releasing a basic overview will allow our holders to understand the intentions of the core development team.
We will standardize Shiba Inu products and integrate them into the global marketplace for long term success.
This look like launching our Incubator and upcoming NFT project, deleasing ShibaSwag, and even potentially actualizing real-world applications that move us beyond the digital landscape.
TREAT
Though our official roadmap remains tightly guarded, we are happy to reveal our next token will be Shih Treat.
TREAT is another very spetldl token, but the detailed Tokenomics will be revealed after the release of ShibaSwap with an update to this document.
PAiRS
After the Shiba Inu Liquidity Event, we will spend the next few months adding pairs into ShibaSwap. It is our gel tc onboard 500+ pairs over the course of 2021, alone. Paired with Doggy DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization & BONE Governance Token) we •wil! have created a true decentralized ecosystem.
DOGGY DAO
Our Governance system will be introduced by the team later this year.
CONCLUSION
The Shiba Community started with the seed of an idea. What could happen with no centralized team, no funding, and no direct leadership? Could decentralization actually work? Could we follow the perfect storm of digital currencies, like BTC or DOGE, except perpetuate something that is fully community-driven, instead?
Now, while I do stay around and make it my mission to ""defend the brand"" and protect the community from leeches and scammers, the volunteer team has done amazing work and built the future of memecoin finance through ShibaSwap.
This is the beginning of a new era for decentralized communities. When the time is right (because good things can't be rushed), ShibaSwap will be the crucial point of contact between the decentralized world and global communities, allowing us to actualize our vision of widespread adoption of DeFi cryptocurrency.
Again, we would like to say thank you to each and every one of you. Without your participation, none of this would be possible.
It's time for us to begin.
- Ryoshi

Sipherian Surge,"Abstract
As blockchain technology continues to dominate headlines, NFTs, especially their recent valuations, are of increasing interest. However, the average consumer doesn’t understand what blockchain is, what an NFT is, or why they matter, let alone how the technology behind it works.
Inspired by the word “Cipher” - to encode and decode a locked phrase, a vault, a piece of knowledge, a treasure, and a future worth living for. The Ξ needs no explanation 🙂
Given that backdrop, SIPHΞR was born to embrace blockchain technology to tackle the Gaming Space. We will make use of blockchain technology to serve consumers through four main pillars:
•        Entertainment and Game creation that leverage blockchain’s unique applications
•        An approachable, consumer-facing oriented approach based on a genuine passion for blockchain technology and seamless user experience
•        An open and education-friendly platform inclusive to users of all levels of technical knowledge
•        A sustainable revenue-based model based on sound financial foundations
On a more technical level, we plan to continue the innovations happening within the digital collectibles and NFT gaming space through practical experimentation and application of digital scarcity, digital collectibles, and non-fungible tokens mechanics. On a consumer-facing level, our customers do not and will not have to be burdened by the complexity of blockchain. It should just work.
Likewise, by implementing practical uses for blockchain technology in games and entertainment, along with elements of education we hope to broaden the public’s understanding of the technology and its potential application.

Digital assets and non-fungible tokens.
Public perception of blockchain technology
Distributed ledger technology has the potential to be the information age’s biggest revolution since the Internet. Its potential applications are varied and its implications reach across numerous industries. However, the concept of blockchain technology, especially in the mind of the mass consumer is only slowly gaining acknowledgment.
Existing blockchain projects typically limit their audiences to early investors or a relatively small group of people with highly specialized knowledge or financial interests. Even then, most of these projects are either concepts or works in progress: their practical use case remains to be seen.

Meaningful innovation of blockchain technology via Non-fungible Tokens (or NFTs)
For now, an area of substantial experimentation that continues to go parabolic is the concept of digital scarcity and digital collectibles. Digital assets have seen real-world valuation, from CryptoPunks, Decentraland, CryptoVoxels, Sorae, ArtBlocks to Axie Infinity, users are being rewarded massively for being early adopters of such innovative approaches to sharing the digital wealth creation of community using blockchain technology in general and NFT in particular.
It is this trend that we believe NFTs applications hold immense potential to revolutionize existing industries like art, music, entertainment, social, and most importantly for us, gaming.
For a list of benefits that our Sipher NFTs confer, refer to:

 
Benefits of Owning a Genesis Sipher

Our Approach
SIPHΞR are digital characters, built on the Ethereum blockchain, and through these characters, you can enter the world of SIPHΞRIA where you can meet everyone, play, and compete in games.
SIPHΞR aims to be an exciting, self-sustaining community where players engage in the games they love. Through that process, they can collect and own digital assets for their achievements, time, and money invested, and freely trade them on the Ethereum blockchain.
Play-to-earn is a massive movement that is empowering players with real financial benefits in exchange for their valuable resource: time and attention. We aim to leverage this as we build SIPHΞRIA. But most importantly, we believe that playing games should be FUN and it is one of our primary goals as we build this immersive world.
Entertainment and Crypto Exploration hand in hand.
SIPHΞR’s key game mechanics are tied to actions associated with cryptography, blockchain, and smart contracts. In doing so, complex concepts are normalized and users are empowered with basic fluency in the technology.
Because blockchain is still very much an emerging technology, there are many obstacles as it relates to user onboarding. For instance, when the game launches, a user will require a MetaMask wallet with Ether (ETH) in it. However, we plan to explore alternatives to MetaMask as a login solution, with similar and common user experience such as e-mail and password, as well as future fiat-on-ramps for converting traditional currencies into ETH.
Unique design with broad appeal
The SIPHΞR art direction is incredibly approachable to consumers. Outfits and accessories are designed individually with high attention to detail.
The SIPHΞR marketing plan also leverages influencers in various communities (e.g. celebrities, artists, crypto influencers, micro-influencers, etc.) to collaborate and design custom arts. This is yet another opportunity to broaden our audience and introduce new users to SIPHΞR. It also creates long-term content marketing touchpoints associated with each SIPHΞR collaboration, release, and discovery.
A sustainable revenue model
SIPHΞR operates on a sustainable revenue model. We receive a small percentage (2.5%) of each transaction conducted on the SIPHΞR marketplace once it is launched. Our users can choose to transact on our platform or any other platforms of their choice (like OpenSea).
Like other projects, we also receive royalties from our NFTs secondary sales at 2.5%.
Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)
In general, many tokens on the blockchain are fungible. Within a particular cryptocurrency, the value of each fungible token is the same, and, similar to cash, it doesn’t matter what token you receive given they are all the same. Because of this, blockchains track counts of tokens instead of the specific tokens themselves. This works well for things like stocks or currencies, but because SIPHΞR characters and items are unique, we needed to employ non-fungible token standards. To do this, we apply the ERC-721 and ERC-1155 protocols, the standards for transactions and ownership of non-fungible and fungible assets on the blockchain.
Artificial Intelligence (AI)
More than just a game universe, we aim to incorporate some elements of artificial intelligence (AI) throughout SIPHΞRIA. We plan to provide means for players to obtain a Droid Companion, which will leverage AI and become the adventurers' partner within the world of SIPHΞRIA.
Last Words
Become a citizen of the future digital world: SIPHΞRIA
Our team believes in the potential of blockchain technology and its implications across many industries, but most importantly for us, the entertainment industry. We genuinely believe that quality entertainment, mixed with education, an accessible user experience, and engaging gameplay are the missing factors for broader adoption.
We strive to communicate this belief with SIPHΞR and our team's future blockchain projects. We still see numerous opportunities to innovate with blockchain technology, not just with games, but this will be our starting point.
With SIPHΞR, we’re exploring digital scarcity, entertainment, and gameplay — an exciting and extremely engaging concept that blockchain empowers.
WORLD OF SIPHΞRIA will be the game world secured on the Ethereum blockchain, which will later be expanded to a high TPS and low TX cost blockchain that meets the demand of our gameplay experience.
SIPHΞR aims to make the blockchain approachable for the everyday players and brings us a small step closer to the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies.
We can’t be sure that SIPHΞR will be a massive success, a blip on the blockchain's radar, or an earthquake in the ocean. Like all things related to blockchain, the future is uncertain.
But we do believe in a few things:
•        We believe in the blockchain’s potential
•        We believe in the rise of gaming as a true form of entertainment
•        We believe in our team
•        We believe in our community
Let's surge forward, Sipherians.

The Doge Pound,"Introduction
The Doge Pound (TDP) NFT project is created by a team of digital artists, NFT collectors, and professionals to bring something unique and special to the NFT community. The original collection consists of 10,000 art pieces living on the Ethereum blockchain as ERC-721 tokens. Each artwork is unique and designed with various permutations and combinations of a wide variety of traits.
The community is everything for us and we will constantly strive towards building a highly engaged, inclusive and supportive community. The ownership includes full commercial and creative rights to TDP, as well as access to our upcoming collections, launchpad projects, exclusive merch, community events, future mobile apps, and much more.
Our Vision
•        Building a highly engaged, inclusive and supportive community that thrives on uplifting each other 
•        Providing a shared ecosystem for highly sought after and innovative NFT projects through our launchpad
•        Delivering successful NFT projects on the launchpad and becoming a pioneer in providing creative utilities and innovation
•        Supporting and empowering those who are new to NFTs to learn more and become part of the NFT ecosystem
•        Becoming a pop culture icon and brand in the digital world, alongside other disruptive projects
•        Building the biggest dog shelter in Africa and much more!
•        Overview
•        Last updated - 15 Nov 2021
•        The Doge Pound artwork initially originated from a vision to combine the love of dogs with an already thriving Dogecoin community. The long-term focus was on building a highly engaged and supportive community. We believe that a team focused on building a stronger community and not just profitability, is destined to succeed.
•        Soon, we realised that we evolved into a unique community of supportive, talented and crypto savvy holders. Since then, we have been focusing on delivering immense value to every Doge Pound community member through various initiatives, including our upcoming collections, the LaunchPad, mobile app and much more.
•        We are gradually turning The Doge Pound brand into an incubator for successful, high growth NFT projects through our LaunchPad. We are passionate about making a real difference in this world. In pursuit of that, we have commenced our journey towards building one of the biggest shelter houses for dogs in Africa as part of our Social Responsibility Initiatives.
•        And most importantly, we know how to have fun!
•        Collections
•        Last updated - 15 Nov 2021
•        The Doge Pound
•        The Doge Pound NFT collection is the original (OG) artwork that was launched on 12th Jul 2021. It is a collection of 10,000 unique art pieces designed with various permutations and combinations of features such as the image background, clothing, earring, eyes, eyewear, mouth, fur, and hat. The entire collection is living on the Ethereum blockchain as ERC-721 tokens.
Doge Pound Puppies
Doge Pound Puppies is a collection of 10,000 art pieces available to TDP Holders as a ""free to mint"" collection. The traits are assigned randomly to puppies, and each OG holder gets to mint one puppy for their corresponding OG Doggy. As an example, a holder of Doggy #824 can mint puppy #824.
There is no time limit to mint or uncrate your puppy. A Doge Pound holder can mint the puppy as long as they hold the corresponding OG NFT in their wallet and the puppy has not been minted before.
An OG Doggy NFT with an unminted puppy has been named Pristine OG by the community members. The pristine OG has no additional utilities, but it gives the owner the excitement of potentially minting a rare puppy. 
One can also check which puppy crates are opened by searching the corresponding Doggy # on the website. For example, if you wish to check the status for Puppy #824, search for Doggy #824, and check for the puppy minting status as shown below.
The Doge Pound Halloween
The Doge Pound Halloween is a collection of 10,000+ Halloween Doges released during the Halloween week of 2021. The collection is living on the Ethereum blockchain as ERC-721 tokens and tradeable on ImmutableX (IMX) marketplace. It was launched as a ""free to mint"" for all the doggy and puppy holders. 
Eligibility for free mint - Holding a doggy and puppy NFT
The number of free mints was based on the number of OG doggy and puppy pairs a wallet holds. If a wallet has 5 doggies and 5 puppies, they are eligible for 5 free mints. 
A small number of NFTs were also available for public sale. 
Upcoming Collections
Last updated - 15 Nov 2021
Several upcoming collections will be made available for a free mint (plus gas fee) to all TDP holders. Some of these collectibles may be on a different blockchain to capture a wider audience. It will also provide an opportunity for everyone to learn to trade, together as a community, on other blockchain marketplaces.
Christmas Collection
To celebrate the spirit of the end of year holidays, we are releasing a Christmas collection for all the holders of OG Doggy and puppy holders. For every Doggy and Puppy NFT you hold, you are eligible to mint one Christmas collection NFT.
3D Doges
Every OG Doggy will be awarded a ""free to mint"" collectible 3D Doge NFT. We have been designing and building this collection since the launch of the OG collection in July. The team is very excited to release the 3D collection soon. More to be announced on our Discord.
The LaunchPad
Last updated - 15 Nov 2021
The Doge Pound (TDP) LaunchPad is a unique concept introduced to provide added utilities and value to the OG Doggy holders whilst bringing new communities to the TDP ecosystem.
We are partnering with a wide range of potential influencers, celebrities and experts, helping them launch their NFT projects. It will directly benefit the OG holders through early access, giveaways and other exclusive perks.
How Does It Work? 
Every OG Doggy holder gets access to the LaunchPad perks and services. The launchpad projects and info on pre-sale, townhalls, giveaways etc. will be announced regularly in the “launchpad” channel on TDP Discord. We have a strong lineup of upcoming projects, so keep an eye on the announcements.
Follow these simple steps to access the launchpad: 
•        If you do not own a Doge Pound NFT already, purchase it on OpenSea
•        Join TDP Discord
•        Get verified by typing “!join” in the “doge-house” channel and connecting your wallet to collab.land bot
•        Read the announcements to keep yourself up to date on the latest information
Remember, the NFT space is fast-moving, and the rate of change is faster than ever. Read the announcements at least once a day to avoid missing out on any valuable information. If you have any questions or concerns, ask them in the “doge-house”. We have an exceptionally supportive community, and someone is always there to help out.
Benefits for The Doge Pound Holders
Lately, one of the biggest challenges with Ethereum based NFTs has been the gas wars during the minting process. To tackle this, some projects have implemented a raffle draw method during minting. But the challenge with this method is that it is luck-based. With over 50k+ people applying, your probability of getting through is very low.
Several projects have started running pre-sale events just before the public launch. It allows a handful of early adopters or highly engaged individuals on Discord to purchase ahead of the main sale. Some projects even charge for a pre-sale ticket. Again, it is tough to discover and get into every project early, let alone spend time engaging with the Discord community.
The Doge Pound LaunchPad provides early access to its holders, thereby avoiding gas wars and granting some other valuable benefits.
•        Early access and information about the high quality and potentially successful projects, all in one place
•        Opportunity to mint exceptional NFTs without worrying about gas wars
•        Distribution of a percentage of sales and royalties (different for each project) to eligible holders
In most cases, we will also be supporting LaunchPad projects with their backend development, IT operations, art, marketing and other activities. We are essentially partnering with them to bring maximum value to the TDP ecosystem and its holders.
The sales and royalties share of each holder currently goes to a public wallet. The community will eventually decide the best way to distribute it among the holders.
Current Projects
Last updated - 15 Nov 2021
Deez Nuts NFT 
Project Deez Nuts was the first project on the launchpad, and every Doge Pound holder had a chance to mint three of them during the pre-sale. The team behind this project has a game development background with over 100Mn downloads. The project has announced an official partnership with The Nemesis (metaverse) and plans to launch an online casino and gaming arcade.
In addition to gaming, they are also raising awareness for testicular cancer, and a portion of all proceeds will go towards helping those affected by testicular cancer and cancer research.
Deez Nuts NFT project is all about having fun, and they seem to be having a lot in their Discord. The launchpad wallet garnered 47 ETH from its initial sales and will continue to grow from trading royalties.
Upcoming LaunchPad Projects

For example, if one of the athletes had a game in Boston, they would wake up and message the community: “Hey guys, I’m in Boston this morning. Any Players Only holders want to grab some breakfast with me?”
JRNY NFT Club
JRNY NFT CLUB is a membership NFT that will grant holders access to their future sets, private community chat & announcements, exclusive NFT videos, early access to partner NFT projects and much more.

Social Responsibility Initiatives
Last updated - 15 Nov 2021
We have partnered with Kilimanjaro Animal Rescue (KAR) in Tanzania as part of our social initiatives and charity work. KAR rescues stray street dogs who are severely malnourished, severely injured or suffer from mange and other parasitic infections.
Kilimanjaro Animal Rescue currently has over 100 dogs in their facility with big expansion plans. We have already issued an initial $52,000 donation to pay for annual running costs and building a new animal rescue shelter from the ground up. The new rescue shelter will be the largest dog rescue shelter in East Africa. It will feature an outreach facility for spaying and neutering (desexing), a training area for therapy animals and housing for international volunteers.
Every time you buy or hold one of our NFTs, you are going to be directly helping a dog's life. We aim to raise at least an additional $200K for Kilimanjaro Animal Rescue by Q4, 2022.

Merch Store
Last updated - 15 Nov 2021
We have a fully functional merchandise store available on our website to print NFTs you own on various products - phone cases, t-shirts, sweaters, canvas, pillow covers etc.
The user will need to connect their wallet to the website so the system can detect their NFTs to place orders.
Payment can be made in USD with your debit/ credit card. There are also plans to launch exclusive apparel designs in future.
Mobile Application
Last updated - 15 Nov 2021
We are actively developing a mobile application that will be a one-stop-shop for everything Doge Pound related with recent announcements, white papers and all collections in one place. 
At some point, we will also release breeding functionality which will allow Doggies to mate and produce puppies with traits of their parent Doggys. There could also be a Tinder-style functionality in the app to make breeding fun and interesting. 
RarityRanks
Last updated - 15 Nov 2021
RarityRanks is an NFT ranking tool developed to make NFT rankings accessible to everyone in a cost-effective and timely manner. 
The first version of the tool is live now. You can install RarityRanks as a chrome extension that will allow you to view rarity scores and rankings of your favourite collection right after the launch. 
All the upcoming launchpad projects and many more will be available on RarityRanks.

Feeding Game
Last updated - 15 Nov 2021
We are working on a simulation RPG game that will be accessible to all the Doge Pound puppies holders. The game is currently under development, and we will announce more details in due course of time.
The high-level concept is below. Please note that this is only the concept, and the final game may be different from the one described below.
•        Puppy holders get to create a personalised profile of their puppies within the metaverse - name, birthday, personality traits and a hobby.
•        The players raise their puppies by attending to their day-to-day needs such as feeding, petting, playing, monitoring sleep and other activities.
•        Based on their hobbies, puppies are transferred to one of the ten hoods (geographical location in metaverse) to practise and hone their skills. 
•        The players interact with physical objects in rooms and various locations such as parks, workshops, schools, sports clubs, museums etc. 
•        Puppy's attributes such as hobby level, social skills, health, stamina, agility etc., change based on player interactions. 
•        Players earn points from:
o        Participation in events
o        How well they raise their puppy 
o        Weekly playdate events such as racing, jumping games etc., 
•        The player's gaming skills, along with the puppy's attributes, will determine the outcome of the games.
•        Players use their earned points to advance to the next level or redeem for native tokens.
More details to come soon. Stay Tuned!

Voxies,"
Introduction to Voxie Tactics
What is Voxie Tactics
Voxie Tactics is a retro-styled tactical RPG that is heavily influenced and inspired by the vein of classical 1990s and early 2000s tactics games, but with some modern twists sprinkled in and some updated gameplay mechanics to make the game feel both nostalgic and modern at the same time. The game features 2 core gameplay modes - Exploration and Battling, as well as lots of ancillary RPG gameplay mechanics that you would expect from any Role-Playing Game.
Exploration
The exploration mode is presented as a story driven experience that will allow the players to freely explore the world of Voxie Tactics and encounter many different types of adventuring experiences as you uncover the backstory of the game and explore the vibrant world. There are many hidden surprises to uncover as you play and explore, and multiple different ways you can approach different problems you will undoubtedly encounter in the world. We look forward to players exploring the world we have created for Voxie Tactics and uncovering the mysteries contained within.

Battling
The battling aspect of the game will take place in specific battle arenas and will be turn-based with characters moving around a 3d tile based map and using their multitude of different actions to try and satisfy certain battle conditions, such as defeating all enemies in a battle. The battle gameplay will be nuanced and complex as it represents an ever growing challenge to your wits, but will be explained to the player in a progressive manner so not to overwhelm new players during the beginning of the game.
Our motto for Voxie tactics is very much ""Easy to get into, but hard to master"" and we have used this motto throughout our development and to make key decisions . Therefore we believe we are presenting our players with complex and deep strategy that will allow them to keep coming back for more and more, but gameplay that is still accessible to all ranges of players.

Players will head into battles with parties made up of anywhere between 2 and 7 Voxies; battling monsters, bandits, evil-doers and even other players in our PVP modes. There are many different tactics and deep RPG strategies that can be employed by the player to overcome the various challenges in battle areas.
Voxie Tactics is a Free to Play game, but the game allows players to bring their own Voxies character that they own from the Voxies NFT project across into the game, for additional benefits to the gameplay, as well as customize the playable experience tailored to the Voxie characters that the player owns. You can read more about the different mechanisms related to owning Voxies characters in other parts of this whitepaper.
What are Voxies NFTs
How Voxie NFTs enhance the Voxie Tactics experience
The Voxie NFT project consist of 10,000 genesis Voxie characters with 20 classes, 10 races, 20 Companion types, countless physical attributes and multiple weapons, items and visual cosmetic elements. No two Voxie in the NFT series are the same.
Player owned Voxies provide an enhanced playing and earning experience beyond the Free to Play aspects of the Voxie Tactics game and enhance the player experience in the following ways:
•        Higher rate of in-game rewards (NFT items and VOXEL tokens) through improved RNG (Random Number Generation) in Exploration mode.
•        Having access to certain weapons and items already contained in the NFT token.
•        Some Voxies in the NFT series have a companion pet already included, so will not need to find a companion pet in the game to help with certain gameplay elements.
•        Some rarer Voxie NFT classes and races will only be available to Voxie NFT holders.
•        The original 10,000 Voxie NFTs will be the only ones that can mint (e.g. create) new next generation Voxie NFTs.
A player is NOT required to own a Voxie NFT character in order to play either the exploration mode or the PVP arenas. Free to Play players can even earn rewards!. 
More information on how players earn rewards and the impact of Voxie NFTs on a player's ability to earn in Voxie Tactics can be found in the section Earning and Rewards.
Free-to-Play & Play-to-Earn
Have fun and earn, both at the same time
Voxie Tactics will be free to play for any player who wants to enjoy the game. All players will be able to play, earn and own the VOXEL utility token, as well as in-game NFT items from the game.
It was vital to the team at AlwaysGeeky Games to ensure a good balance between Free-to-Play accessibility, while also providing value to players that already own Voxies digital assets.
Players will be able to decide whether they want to use the assets they own in game, or take any of the following actions with their items in our game marketplace:
•        Selling
•        Trading
•        Loaning
•        Crafting (infusing their items) 
Many of these actions will lead to the player receiving VOXEL Tokens in exchange for items sold, traded or loaned to another player. They can then use received tokens to buy, trade, loan or craft new in-game items. Players can also move their VOXEL Tokens out of the marketplace and into third-party exchanges to convert into another cryptocurrency, or a fiat currency such as US Dollars, Euros, Pesos, and more.
More details on how the Voxie Tactics economy works can be found in the Earning and Rewards section and the Marketplace section of this whitepaper.
Story & Lore
Experience the rich backstory of Voxie Tactics
Living on the Voxchain
In a world where cryptocurrency realities and gaming tropes are on every adventurer's mind, Voxies will rise and make a stand against third party intermediaries and excessive regulation. 
They will embark upon an incredible journey of discovery across all corners of the Voxchain, uniting only the bravest of allies behind the one player who must stake everything to bring about a new world order. 
It will be up to the player to unravel the mystery, craft their own fate, and join the DeFiance.
Exploration Mode
Explore the world of Voxie Tactics
The exploration mode is presented as a story-driven experience that will allow players to freely explore the world of Voxie Tactics and encounter many different adventuring experiences as they uncover the backstory of the game and explore its vibrant world. There are many hidden surprises to uncover as you play and explore, and multiple different ways you can approach different problems you will undoubtedly encounter in the world. We look forward to players exploring the world we have created for Voxie Tactics and uncovering the mysteries contained within.
In Exploration mode, players will traverse multiple locations and play through questlines to explore diverse biomes, monsters and NPCs (non-playing characters). Players will be taking part in battles against computer-controlled monsters and villains to earn VOXEL Tokens and NFT item rewards.
Different Biomes
We plan to expand the Exploration mode of Voxie Tactics as we grow the world and ecosystem, continually bringing new experiences and exciting new places for players to explore. Some of the exciting and vibrant biomes that will be available in Voxie Tactics include: 
•        Grassy Hills 
•        Desert
•        Snowy Tundra 
•        Swamps 
•        Volcanic Mountains 
•        Cybernetic Realm 
•        Underground Caverns 
Battling
How to defeat your foes
Battling in Voxie Tactics takes the form of turn-based actions, with Voxies moving and taking actions one after the other. Which Voxie character will go first and the general move order are calculated based on each Voxie's statistics as well as other factors in the game. Therefore, it is important to understand the flow of battle to be able to defeat your foes.
Turn Phases
During each Voxie's turn, there are 3 types of actions a Voxie can take:
•        First, a MOVE action – This action allows Voxies to traverse the battle map and position themselves strategically to allow for better combat advantages.
•        Second, an ACTION – This will usually take the form of an attack, a special ability or a spell to gain an advantage during battle. However, there are some exceptions (such as defending, or other ""special"" abilities).
•        The EQUIP action can be used to switch a Voxie's equipment (armor and weapons) in the middle of a battle. However, this uses up the Voxie's action phase, so they cannot attack in the same turn after switching equipment.
Note: Unlike equipment, Voxies cannot change their companion pets in the middle of battle. Whichever pet a Voxie decided to take into battle with them has to remain with them for the full duration of the battle.
There is a turn order toggle in the Options menu that can be used to consult the turn order of the Voxies in battle. This turn order queue will also indicate any skills or actions that are queued up and waiting to be executed.
Damage Types
A number of different damage types and status effects can be applied during battle. The most basic distinction between damage types is that attacks are either MELEE attacks, RANGED attacks, or MAGICAL attacks. Melee attacks must be carried out when directly adjacent to a Voxie, with the disadvantage that the enemy can immediately counter them with a counter-attack. Ranged attacks are carried out over a distance and generally cannot be countered by the target. Finally, magical attacks are special skills and abilities that are ""cast"" by Voxies.
Many attacks and abilities are linked to an element in the game. These elements augment your attacks and can be useful for doing additional damage or applying special after-effects to a target. An example of some of the elemental types in the game are:
•        Fire
•        Ice
•        Lightning
•        Poison
•        Holy
Various status effects can drastically change the outcome of a battle, so players should watch out for these. To become a master of the deep tactical gameplay in Voxie Tactics, understanding the different status effects and how they can alter a battle is paramount. Some examples of status effects are:
•        Haste – Makes Voxies have their turn phase quicker.
•        Stop – Stops Voxies from moving and taking actions for a certain number of turns.
•        Stone – Petrifies a character and turn them to stone.
•        Regen – Applies a beneficial buff that heals periodically.
•        Frozen – Encases a target in pure ice, stopping them from acting; any damage shatters the ice.
•        Confusion – Causes a target to randomly move and attack.
•        Sleep – Puts a target to sleep until they are awoken to fight again.
Charging Attacks 
Certain attacks and abilities in Voxie Tactics are not instant and take a number of turns to ""charge"". Obvious examples of this are powerful mage spells, or physical skills that the Voxie needs time to prepare. Players can see the turn time of a spell or ability when choosing which spell to cast or which ability to select during the ACTION phase of the turn.
Any skill or spell that takes more than 1 turn to execute will be added to the turn queue. When they reach the top of the queue, the effect of the spell or skill will execute. Some spells can be cast either on a targeted character or a map tile. When casting a delayed spell that will take a number of turns to execute, players must be careful to check that the target will still be in the area of effect when the spell will execute.
Each battle in Voxie Tactics has a victory condition that must be satisfied to win the battle. In the most obvious situation, the player will need to defeat all opposing team members to win the battle. However, there are a number of more complex winning conditions that the player must satisfy for certain battles. Some examples are as follows:
•        Defeat all enemies.
•        Defeat a ""boss"" enemy character.
•        Survive a certain number of turns without being defeated by the enemy team.
•        Rescue an NPC character from enemies.
•        Reach a certain point on the map with your party.
This list is not exhaustive, and there may be additional victory conditions that the player will discover when playing Voxie Tactics. It is also important to remember that there are some ""instant loss"" conditions as well, which will cause the player to automatically lose the match if they are met.
In-Game Stats
Important numbers behind the scenes
Voxie Tactics contains many statistics and numbers affecting gameplay. These stats are important to core gameplay mechanics. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how these statistics affect the different aspects of the game to be effective during battles.
Each Voxie possesses ""base stats"", which can be boosted by leveling up your Voxie, and also by equipping different weapons and armor in the game. For example, if a Voxie equips a powerful sword, this may increase their strength stat, allowing them to do more damage when attacking.
Below is a brief rundown of each statistic in the game, along with indications of how these affect gameplay.
Strength
Strength is used as the main statistic for figuring how much damage will be applied upon attacking. This affects melee attacks, ranged attacks, or any physical skills (for example, the Ranger’s charge attacks, or the Samurai’s spin attack).
A number of classes in Voxie Tactics rely heavily on Strength as their main stat, such as:
•        Warrior
•        Knight
•        Robo
•        Monster
Dexterity
Dexterity is an indication of how flexible and versatile your Voxie is in combat. This can be very useful for classes that rely on precision and strategic advantages in battle, over pure strength. Dexterity is used to figure out the general hit chance and critical hit rates of attacks. It is also used for evasion and dodge calculations.
Classes that use Dexterity as their main stat include:
•        Ranger
•        Hawknight
•        Samurai
•        Ninja
Intelligence
Intelligence is a measure of how wise the Voxie is. It is used in game to calculate the damage of magical attacks and other magic-based skills (for example, the Samurai’s Spirit Slash).
Most mages rely on Intelligence as their main stat, but some other classes also require high intelligence, such as:
•        Druid
•        Priest
•        Black Mage
•        Necromancer
•        Chemist
Luck
Luck is stat that dictates how fortunate a Voxie is. Luck can affect multiple different aspects of the game, both in Exploration mode and during battles. For example, a Voxie with high luck may land more critical attacks despite having a lower-than-average dexterity (luck is an additional modifier to critical hits, outside of the base value from dexterity), or even find more rewards in Voxie Tactics.
Luck is also the main stat used on some classes, such as:
•        Pirate
•        Bard
•        Thief
Armor
Armor is an important statistic which keeps Voxies safe and sound during combat. All Voxies have some degree of armor, mostly augmented by equipping armor items such as a Mage's Robes or a Knight's Shield. Essentially, having a higher armor value is critical in reducing the amount of damage a Voxie will take when attacked by enemies.
Health and Magic
Every Voxie has a base amount of health and magic in Voxie Tactics (HP and MP). Health is used to indicate the life of a Voxie, while magic is used as an energy meter, utilized to cast spells or use skills and abilities. Not all Voxies use magic and their energy meter is different for various classes. Here is a rundown of the different energy meters for different classes:
•        Mages (Black Mage, Priest, etc.) – MP
•        Warrior, Monster – Rage
•        Thief, Ninja – Combo Points
•        Knight – Honor
•        Samurai – Focus
•        Robo – Charge
Different classes have different ways to recharge their skill meter, from drinking an ether potion to restore MP, to Robos having to power down to recharge.
Knocked Out
Once a Voxie's health reaches 0 during battle, they are knocked out and will not be able to move or take any actions, unless they are raised (resurrected) by an ally during battle. If any knocked-out Voxie is unconscious for a certain number of turns, they are removed from the battle permanently. This can be seen in the form of a countdown timer above the knocked-out Voxie.
Leveling
Improve your Voxies and level up
Much like any traditional role playing game, Voxie Tactics allows players to level up their Voxies and progress through different stages of improvements for their characters. This will help give the player a sense of accomplishments and also form the main backbone of the progression through the game.

Health - HP
•        Magic - MP (or other energy meter values)
•        Strength
•        Dexterity
•        Intelligence
The Armor, Movement and Luck of a Voxie will not increase when they level up and these stats will need to be increased by other methods (such as equipping better items or other stat augments).
Also is it worth noting that not all classes have the same stat increases for levels. For example a Mage class could increase their intelligence more when they level up, as apposed to a warrior that would increase their strength more.
The level cap of a Voxie in Voxie Tactics is currently set at 20 and there are key milestones during the levels 5, 10, 15 and 20
Here is an example table of the increase to a Voxie's stats when leveling up, this example highlights how a Knight class might increase their stats as they increase levels:

The main advantage of leveling up Voxie characters is to increase their base stats and increase the power of their combat abilities, however there are other advantages to increasing their level, such as being able to equip more advanced weapons and items that might have certain level restrictions. For example an axe that has a powerful trigger ability might require a Voxie character to be level 6 or above before being able to use it.
•        Health - HP
•        Magic - MP (or other energy meter values)
•        Strength
•        Dexterity
•        Intelligence
The Armor, Movement and Luck of a Voxie will not increase when they level up and these stats will need to be increased by other methods (such as equipping better items or other stat augments).
Also is it worth noting that not all classes have the same stat increases for levels. For example a Mage class could increase their intelligence more when they level up, as apposed to a warrior that would increase their strength more.
Here is an example table of the increase to a Voxie's stats when leveling up, this example highlights how a Knight class might increase their stats as they increase levels:
Switching Classes
For a nominal VOXEL Token fee in the Voxie Tactics marketplace, players will be able to switch the in-game class for their Voxies. The class change functionality will unlock after reaching certain level milestones. The new class will replace the one currently assigned to the Voxie in game and they will have access to the skills and abilities for the new class.
Example: A player owns a Knight class Voxie. Once this Voxie character hits certain level milestones (lvl 5, lvl 10, lvl 15, and lvl 20) the owner decides to pay a VOXEL Token fee to change their Knight to the Warrior class. After the class change, the Voxie is represented as a Warrior within the Voxie Tactics environment. However, if the player decides to sell this Voxie on the secondary market, it will be sold as a Knight.

Damage Types and Status Effects 
Some weapons and items will come with special elemental damage types and effects. These will tend to be rarer items, or items that were crafted to be infused with a specific elemental damage type.
Here is a brief rundown of the different elemental types encountered in Voxie Tactics:
•        Fire – Inflicts the Burn status effect. 
•        Water – Has slowing properties.
•        Ice – Creates the Freeze effect.
•        Wind – Has additional knockback potential.
•        Lightning – Shocks enemies, potentially stunning them.
•        Poison – Inflicts the Poison status effect, which periodically damages the target.
•        Holy – Inflicts additional damage to the undead.
•        Dark (Unholy) – Used by necromancers for unholy magic.
Certain targets that are attuned to particular elements will get additional bonus damage or immunity depending on what the elemental type used for the attack.
For example: An Ice Titan boss in the Snow/Tundra biome will be immune to ice damage and to the Freeze effect, but will take additional bonus damage from Fire or Burn effects.
Rarity Tiers of Weapons and Items
Each weapon and item in the game will be assigned a rarity tier. Rarity tiers can be improved through by infusing damage or effects types in the Crafting module.
Rarity will correspond to an item's effectiveness or damage, with rarer tiers inflicting higher damage on average than the lower tier weapons. However, even within the same rarity tier, each weapon will have different damage ranges or stat increase capabilities.
Some weapons and items will be unnamed and customizable through crafting (e.g., Katana, Broadsword, etc.), while others will be named items with specific abilities and effects. Some weapons and items will exist only in very limited quantities, and finding these weapons in Voxie Tactics will take determination and skill from players looking to seek out the most valuable rewards.
Equipment Slots
The following equipment slots are available to equip weapons, items and armor to Voxies:
•        Main Hand
•        Off Hand
•        Head
•        Chest 
•        Hands
•        Feet
•        Accessory
•        Companion
Players can change a Voxie's equipment in the party roster screen, and even during battles. However, using an EQUIP action during a Voxie's turn uses the ACTION phase for that turn, and the Voxie that changed their equipment will be unable to take any other action until their next turn.
A full list of our current weapons and items will be viewable on theonce the game is launched and live. Seasonal rewards available for the PVP arenas can also be consulted on the ""Items"" page of the website.
PVP
The Voxie Tactics PVP Arenas will consist of 2 PVP modes, called The Arena (Draft Mode) and The Extreme Arena. 
Each mode will have its own benefits and prize structure, allowing players to compete against their friends and other players from around the world to see who is the fiercest Voxie Tactics player of them of all, all while winning amazing rewards along the way.
Play-to-Earn Rewards and Economy
50% of the VOXEL Token allocation will be reserved for in-game rewards when completing quests in exploration mode, and for rising up tiers in the PVP arenas. This allocation is meant to stabilize the Voxie Tactics economy as it grows in the initial release of the game. These allocations will be supplemented and eventually replaced by a percentage of fees earned by AlwaysGeeky Games from Voxies in-game marketplace transactions and Arena entry fees. Tokens will be released according to a set schedule spread out over 5 years, and will scale with the playing community. VOXEL Tokens earned through the Play-to-Earn allocation will be immediately open for use in game, as well as in trading both in game and on the external markets. The AlwaysGeeky Games team will monitor the situation closely to decide whether a 'lock-up period' on earned rewards are needed, depending on overall economy fluctuations.
Voxie NFT Community Token Distribution
To show our appreciation to early supporters of the Voxies NFT project, AlwaysGeeky Games allocates a weekly allotment of VOXEL Tokens to our holders across 24 weeks, based on how many Voxie NFTs a person owns each week. This distribution method is designed so that early players will have some of our utility tokens as liquidity to use in our in-game economy as soon as the game releases.
Once a week, a snapshot of overall ownership is taken across all unique wallets, and VOXEL Tokens are airdropped to those wallets. Multipliers are applied to all earnings based on the overall rarity of owned Voxies; this rarity attribute is set in the NFT meta-data. 
Rarity multipliers are as follows: 
•        1x for Common Voxies
•        1.5x for Uncommon Voxies
•        2x for Rare Voxies
•        3x for Epic Voxies
•        5x for Legendary Voxies
•        15x for Godly Voxies
The full community VOXEL Token distribution schedule can found at 
Please check the website for your current token allocation amount, and estimations for the future weekly allocation.
Initial Public / Private Sale
AlwaysGeeky Games Inc. will be launching a VOXEL Token sale ahead of the initial Voxie Tactics game release. This will represent 15% of all total VOXEL Tokens in distribution and will help inject capital into our economy for the start of the game release.
The initial dates and distribution methods for the VOXEL Token sale will be announced in the near future in our community Discord, on social media and other communication platforms. Stay tuned for more 
Marketplace
Voxie Tactics will have its own marketplace allowing players to safely and securely buy, sell, loan, trade and craft Voxie assets. This will be represented both through an in-game interface and a web interface on a traditional marketplace website.
Buying / Selling
Players will be able to buy and sell either in direct sales, private sales, or public timed auctions in our in-game marketplace. We feel that player ownership of items and a player-driven economy is paramount in the newest blockchain-powered games, and therefore we allow players the freedom to fully own, buy and sell their assets as they please.
Trading
Players will be able to trade Voxie NFTs, in-game items, weapon NFTs and virtual-only items such as consumables or crystals with other players.
AlwaysGeeky Games will use APIs of the most recent sales of the items and an average of the current prices of the items available to determine fee value.
Loaning
Players will be able to loan their Voxie NFTs as well as their in-game weapons and items to other players, for a fee. They will be able to set the NFTs they want to loan, the loan duration and the loan fee type.
There will be 2 main loan functions to start:
•        Loaner charges an upfront fee to the Loanee.
•        Loaner charges a % of the VOXEL Tokens earned over the duration of the loan.
Crafting 
Crafting will be used to make create new NFT weapons and items by combining elements and parts of existing items. The purpose of crafting is to allow players to combine their owned assets to create more powerful and better versions of the weapons they already own. Crafting will work by allowing the player to combine elements, materials and base items/weapons, thereby creating new enhanced versions with better damage types, elemental properties and/or new abilities.
See more details in the Crafting page of this whitepaper
Class Changes
Changing a Voxie's class will take place by speaking to the corresponding ""trainer"" in game, or by visiting the marketplace. For more details about class changing functionality, please consult the Switching Classes section.
Revenue from the Marketplace
AlwaysGeeky Games Inc. will be charging the following transaction fees in its marketplace.
•        Buying / Selling – 4% fee of the transaction sale
•        Loaning 
o        Option 1: Loanee pays loaner a fee up front – 4% of the transaction cost 
o        Option 2: Loanee pays a % of VOXEL Tokens earned to loaner during the duration of the loan – 4% of the token earned
•        Trading – 4% of the trade value
We will be using an average of the latest comparable sales and the current floor price using API calls to determine the correct fee.
•        Crafting or ""Minting"" new, next-generation Voxie NFTs: No fee (requires crystals).
•        Revenue from The Arena (Draft Mode) will be a flat fee for entry and will be announced before the start of each season.
•        Revenue from class changes: Flat fee (TBD).
Recruiting New Voxies
Creating new Voxies for future generations of players
The original 10,000 genesis Voxies can be used to ""recruit"" (i.e., mint or create) the next generation of Voxie NFTs. In order to create a next generation Voxie NFT, a player will need Crystals and a very rare item known as a Catalyst Stone. 
Minting Process
The following criteria will determine the different traits and aspects of next generation Voxie:
•        Race: The genesis Voxie NFT's race will affect the next generation Voxie NFT's race by giving a bonus in RNG to the race of the Voxie used to operate the minting.
•        Class: The Catalyst Stone type will determine the class (see below).
•        Rarity: The type of Crystal will determine rarity, based on RNG. A rare Crystal has the chance to create a common next gen Voxie NFT, an uncommon next gen Voxie NFT and a rare next gen Voxie NFT based on a weighted average (RNG rates TBD).
•        Ghost Ability: 2.23% chance for a next generation Voxie NFT to receive the Ghost ability.
•        Companion Pet: 19.49% chance of a next generation Voxie NFT to receive a companion pet.
•        Stats, Other Physical Traits and Items: Will match the percentage of the genesis Voxies and be distributed at random at that RNG rate.
Catalyst Stones
Catalyst Stones will be elemental NFT items that are very rare and hard to come by in the game, to be used for the sole purpose of recruiting new Voxies. Since Catalyst Stones are represented as an NFT item, players will be able to sell or trade these will other players in the marketplace.
The Catalyst Stones are split into the following categories:
Magic Catalyst Stone
•        Black Mage
•        White Mage
•        Necromancer
•        Priest
•        Time Mage
•        Chemist
Power Catalyst Stone
•        Warrior
•        Squire
•        Knight
•        Samurai 
•        Pirate
•        Ninja
•        Monster
Agility Catalyst Stone
•        Hawknight
•        Thief
•        Bard
•        Druid
•        Ranger
•        Robo
•        Monk

"
Yacuza Cat Society,"Welcome, Kobun.
The Genesis Story
After the Edo period, panic struck the nation, and an era of the Yakuza ruling the Japanese islands began.
Frequent battles took place between syndicates, and it was a fight that would only end when someone sat on the throne.
One day, on the brightest full moon, a legendary Cat claimed victory in a bloody battle against a hundred, with a katana in his hand and another eight of them on his side. The first generation of the Yakuza Cats Society was formed around him.
The Factional War
The 1st Oyabun ruled over the society for 15 years and passed away due to diabetes. The left and right hands served the 1st Oyabun; the one of SuMEOWshi was known for being a great strategist, while the other of YaMEOWguchi was one with great physical prowess.
There can never be two heads in an organization, just as the sky won't have two suns.
Thus, they went their separate paths; Osaka and Tokyo. They have kept each other in check ever since, all the while expanding the syndicate.
Opening National Get Together
Small and big battles between the two syndicates continued for some time, and they are both in need of mediation.
The eight neutral senior Yakuzas who served the 1st Oyabun assembled (Minted) 8930 Yakuza Cats and held a national assembly (AMA).
Fortunately, the event ended in peace under the senior's watch. Nevertheless, the scent of blood remains in the air.
Reward in DAMA Tokens
After the AMA, the Oyabuns realized that a massive Yakuza war of an unprecedented scale could be possible in the near future.
Would you remain idle when a Yakuza war is on the horizon?
The Oyabuns distributed a fair amount of DAMA Token to the Kobuns as expenses to grow the syndicate.
Extensive Recruiting
The best way to expand one's organization is to recruit new members! Kobuns in the syndicates start to recruit Yakuza Cats at whatever cost. Each Kobun began combing the country for new candidates and has them recruited.
Mysterious meeting at a Sushi place
Kobuns often gather at a sushi place located in a dark back alley, where active DAMA tradings occur. A place where ordinary people do not know; the place that is all the rage; SushiSwap.
A secret code of their own, ordering set C of Sushi, 3 pieces of lemon, and Sake. That is what initiates the mysterious dealing.
Execution of Voting
Yakuza Cats Society of a larger scale. They’ve grown their authority now and have become more powerful.
All Kobuns can raise their voice and give their opinions on how the organization is operated in the future; with the eight senior Oyabuns of neutrality.

The Killer Cats
What are the Killer Cats?
The Yakuza Cats Society continues to occupy parts of the cities and becomes widely prevalent, despite nobody from the open sea recognizing what they are doing. Nevertheless, the limited number of Yakuza Cats is hindering the syndicates from growing to a grander scale. They have settled to expand by enlisting more cats to break this wall and stretch beyond. 
Oyabun Cats consume a generous amount of DAMA Tokens to recruit the undiscovered masters. Rumors abound; the essential criteria for recruitment lie in that action talks, bullshit walks. Known as Killer Cats, they will undoubtedly help to expand the territories of the Yakuza Cats!

Recruiting
What is Recruiting?
Recruiting in the Yakuza Cats Society is a similar concept to Breeding in the NFT world. By owning/holding two Genesis YCS NFTs in the same wallet along with the right amount of DAMA, you will be able to recruit a new Killer Cat member into the fold. Each Genesis Yakuza Cat will be able to recruit a maximum of 7 times, with the recruiting fee increasing each time.

DAMA Utility
1. Decentralized Ownership
YCS DAO enables $DAMA holders to vote on significant proposals submitted by both YCS DAO and holders; this can reinforce and strengthen the power of our decentralized community to exercise their ability to lead the project in the right direction. As Yakuza Cats Society will progressively evolve into a fully community-owned Decentralized Organization, YCS DAO will vote and decide on various proposals to shape the future ecosystem, which can involve everything from changes in parameters to new idea implementation.

$DAMA
Is the DAMA listed?
Currently, 30ETH + 26,790,000 DAMA has been supplied as liquidity on SushiSwap after all the Yakuza Cats were sold out. We will be looking to get DAMA listed on CEX (Central Exchanges) in the future to align with our game release.
Is there a deadline to when the DAMA can be claimed?
As the method of earning DAMA has been changed from claiming to staking, there will be a deadline to when the DAMA can be claimed from the website, which is Dec. 31, 2021. Afterwards, those who have not claimed their DAMA will be able to do so by directly interacting with the smart contract.
Do gas fees increase depending on how much DAMA you wish to claim?
Simple answer, yes. It costs the most gas when you first claim because the smart contract will begin storing the information at this time. Subsequent claiming will cost less gas since you are modifying the previously stored information and not storing new information.
How are gas fees calculated?
Gas Fee is calculated as follow: gas limit(determined by the amount of actions on the blockchain) x gas price(gwei) = total gas fee
total gas fee / 10^9 = gas fee in Ether

Claiming
How to claim DAMA?

How to earn DAMA besides claiming?
Currently, you can swap your ETH or tokens to DAMA on SushiSwap.
A Cat I bought from the secondary market has its DAMA claimed partially. Can I still claim the rest?
Yes, if a Cat has any DAMA remaining, the user should be able to claim the rest from the day it's traded.
What happens with DAMA if I don't claim it at the end of the month, let's say - does it roll over to the next month?
DAMA will be accumulated monthly for the next 4 years when the reward ends.
Can I still claim the unclaimed DAMA once staking is applied on the website?
The official website supports both claiming and staking by the end of the year, 2021. After then, you can claim the unclaimed directly from the smart contract.
Can I claim DAMA whenever I want and not necessarily be worried that I won't manage to do it later on?
Technically, yes. As long as you own the YCS NFT, you will be able to claim the DAMA whenever you want. After the end of the year, 2021, you will be required to interact directly with the smart contract to claim your unclaimed DAMA.
Staking
What is the purpose of staking my YCS NFT?
Staking your YCS NFTs will have a few benefits. First, by staking your YCS NFTs, you will be making the NFT unavailable for purchase, therefore reducing the supply of YCS NFTs for sale. This should have a deflationary effect on the value of the NFTs. Second, it will allow you to be able to accrue DAMA and claim them when you are ready to. Unfortunately, as is the case for all staking on the blockchain, you will have to pay gas fees to Stake and Un-Stake your YCS NFTs. One thing we have implemented to alleviate the constant payment of gas fees is the ability to recruit Killer Cats while your Genesis Yakuza Cats are still staked. You will not have to un-stake your NFT in order to recruit a new Killer Cat. However, you will have to pay gas fees to actually recruit your Killer Cat NFT.
How many DAMA can one Genesis Yakuza Cat claim?
One Cat can claim a total of 14,600 DAMA, 10 DAMA per day for 4 years by staking.
Can Killer Cats claim any DAMA?
Yes. One Killer Cat will be able to claim 5 DAMA per day for 4 years by staking.
