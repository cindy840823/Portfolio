# Product Sales Data Warehouse

## Overview
This project demonstrates a data warehouse's design, implementation, and analysis for managing product sales. The project includes:
1. Database schema design using SQL.
2. An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for visualizing the database structure.
3. Analysis and insights derived from querying sales data.

The project aims to showcase expertise in database design, querying, and deriving actionable business insights.

## Objectives
- Create a relational database for product sales data using SQL.
- Visualize the database structure with an ERD to understand table relationships.
- Perform data analysis to uncover sales trends, product popularity, and customer behavior.
- Provide actionable recommendations to improve sales and optimize business strategies.

## Files
- **`Product_Sales_DataWarehouse.sql`**:
  - SQL script for creating and populating the data warehouse.
  - Includes dimensions such as `DimCustomer`, `DimProduct`, `DimStores`, `DimSalesPerson`, and `DimDate`, along with the fact table `FactProductSales`.
- **`Sales Data Analysis Insights.pdf`**:
  - A report summarizing key findings, trends, and recommendations from the sales data analysis.
  - Highlights include:
    - Identification of popular product types and sales trends.
    - Monthly sales analysis and insights on improving seasonal performance.
    - Correlation between website traffic and sales.
- **`Product Sales Data Warehouse Schema and ERD.png`**:
  - A visual representation of the database schema showing table relationships and cardinalities.

## Key Features
- **Database Schema**:
  - **Fact Table**: Captures sales transactions and associated metrics like quantity, sales total cost, and deviations.
  - **Dimension Tables**: Provide detailed information on customers, products, stores, salespersons, and time.
- **SQL Queries**:
  - Analyze product popularity and sales trends.
  - Investigate customer purchasing behavior.
  - Identify opportunities for seasonal promotions and marketing efforts.
- **Insights**:
  - Gift cards and seasonal events can boost sales performance.
  - Data-driven recommendations for improving website traffic and conversion rates.

## Tools Used
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- Data visualization tools for creating the ERD (e.g., Visio or Lucidchart)
- Word processing for documentation and reporting

## Recommendations
- **Promote Gift Cards**:
  - Encouraging the use of gift cards as a sales driver.
- **Seasonal Promotions**:
  - Leverage data to schedule discounts and events during low-sales periods.
- **Website Optimization**:
  - Use traffic and sales data to improve user experience and boost conversions.

## Future Work
- Expand the database schema to include additional dimensions, such as marketing campaigns and customer loyalty programs.
- Automate reporting for real-time business insights.
- Implement machine learning models to predict future sales and customer preferences.
